150,1,F-2022-298,Artificial sweeteners influence microbiome,"New research shows that common artificial sweeteners can cause previously healthy gut bacteria to become sick and invade the gastrointestinal wall, potentially leading to serious health problems. The study by Shil and Chichger (2021) , published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, is the first to show the pathogenic effects of some of the most commonly used artificial sweeteners, saccharin, sucralose and aspartame, on two types of gut bacteria, E. coli (Escherichia coli) and E. faecalis (Enterococcus faecalis). Previous studies have shown that artificial sweeteners can change the number and type of bacteria in the gut, but this new molecular research, led by scientists at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), has shown that sweeteners can also make the bacteria pathogenic. It was found that these pathogenic bacteria can attach to, invade, and kill Caco-2 cells, the epithelial cells that line the gastrointestinal wall. It is known that bacteria such as E. faecalis that cross the intestinal wall can enter the bloodstream and accumulate in the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen, causing a range of infections including septicaemia. In this new study, it was found that at concentrations equivalent to two cans of diet soft drink, all three artificial sweeteners significantly increased the adhesion of E. coli and E. faecalis to intestinal Caco-2 cells and differentially increased the formation of biofilms (Eurek Alert).The substance D-allulose belongs to the group of simple sugars (monosaccharides).The specific risk of favouring human pathogenic bacteria in the human body by food ingredients is to be considered as a possible ""emerging risk"". Aspartame, an artificial sweetener, has been repeatedly criticised for not being safe. This thesis has been taken up in various studies and examined by means of meta-analyses. The authors Millstone and Dawson conclude that it is premature to call aspartame 'safe' because the studies conducted by the EFSA to assess aspartame are flawed.Concerns are also raised concerning the sweetener D-allulose. The sweetness of D-allulose corresponds to about 70% of the sweeteness of household sugar (sucrose), but leads to a significantly lower calorie intake, which is why the substance is advertised as a sugar substitute. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has yet to issue an opinion on the safety of D-allulose as a novel food. The BfR (German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment) reported that the use of D-allulose as a food ingredient could selectively promote the growth of bacteria of the Klebsiella genus, such as K. pneumoniae, in the human body. From a risk assessment perspective, the extent to which regular consumption of previously uncommon amounts of D-allulose as a novel food will undesirably influence the occurrence of Klebsiella spp. in the human gut microbiome remains to be scientifically determined.",True,2022-05-31T00:00:00,2023-10-17T07:41:23,2.0,23.0,[648]
64,1,F-2019-103,Milk substitutes made from cashews,"Vegan nutrition is in vogue. Companies are responding by creating new milk substitutes, including cashew nut-based ones. In Switzerland, cheese has been made from cashew nuts since 2015. 50 to 60 tonnes of organic cashews are imported from Vietnam every year. The cashew milk is processed raw and not pasteurised, only the ""ricotta"" and the products sold in the retail trade are thermised at 65 degrees to make them last longer. The concern here is that products are not necessarily pasteurised, especially as nuts can be contaminated by micro-organisms and/or pesticides. In many countries, nuts are harvested by hand and dried in the sun. Contamination can occur through insects, birds, rodents, but also through air and soil. Wet, humid conditions also pose a significant risk for the formation of aflatoxins. Nuts and seeds are known sources of salmonella, but E. coli O157 can also be frequently detected.",True,2019-10-17T00:00:00,2023-02-13T13:23:02,2.0,11.0,[186]
169,1,F-2021-320,Coumarin in food supplements,"Coumarin is a natural flavouring and fragrance substance found in many plants (e.g., lavender) and thus also in some foods. It is found in higher concentrations in certain types of cinnamon and in woodruff. From a toxicological point of view, coumarin is considered to be a cause for concern as it has been shown to be carcinogenic in animal experiments in high doses; an increased cancer risk for humans has not yet been proven. Furthermore, coumarins inhibit the vitamin K metabolism and thus influence blood clotting. In high intake quantities, coumarin can cause liver damage, in extreme cases hepatitis with liver failure. Even small amounts of the substance can cause liver damage in sensitive individuals, although this damage is reversible.The genotoxicity (genetic damage) of coumarin could not be confirmed. Coumarin may be contained in cinnamon capsules in particular. At higher doses, it is possible to exceed the daily dose for coumarin (Verbraucherzentrale, Deutschland).",False,2021-11-16T00:00:00,2023-03-09T08:01:42,1.0,5.0,[327]
190,1,F-2022-346,Tick-borne meat allergy,"Meat allergy was first observed in the 1990s and formally described in 2009, which makes it a relatively recent arrival to the compendium of allergic conditions. Its most curious quality may be that it is seemingly triggered by a tick bite. In America, the culprit, called the lone-star tick, females have a distinctive white splotch on their backs, is common in the warm and humid Southeast, where most cases of meat allergy have been diagnosed.This syndrome is called AlphaGal syndrome (AGS). Individuals are allergic to a sugar molecule, which does not occur in humans but is on a large number of cells in all other mammals. It is a sugar with the name galactose-alpha-1,3 galaktose, or alpha-galactose, or alpha-gal for short. AGS patients develop a disease after eating mammalian meat, dairy products or even cosmetics containing animal ingredients. Allergy symptoms: from thick lips, shortness of breath and itchy skin to circulatory problems and unconsciousness. Many suffer from abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhoea.",False,2022-05-09T00:00:00,2023-07-28T07:42:32,2.0,5.0,[684]
