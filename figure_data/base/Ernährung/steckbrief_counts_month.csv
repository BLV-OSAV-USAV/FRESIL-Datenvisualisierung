95,1,F-2020-135,Ultraprocessed food,"Since 1980, scientific literature has reported on the links between the prevalence of certain health conditions and the high consumption of ultra-processed food (see NOVA Klassifikation for definition of ultraprocessed food). The increased consumption of this type of food may be responsible for the increase in incidence of many health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, loss of microbial diversity, dysbiosis, other inflammation-related diseases of the digestive system, increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced. Additives are often used to improve shelf life and taste, and chemical contaminants can result from processing methods. Maximum permitted levels for food additives and contaminants are set to protect consumers, but their cumulative effects are largely unknown.",False,2020-01-06T00:00:00,2023-11-23T07:27:30,1.0,21.0,[924]
36,1,F-2019-056,Climate change and its impact on food safety,"Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2023-10-31T14:07:40,1.0,19.0,[906]
234,1,F-2023-017,PFAS in water and soils,"During the last 20 years, guideline values for Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water, surface waters, and soils have decreased dramatically due to new insights into their toxicity. As a result, levels in environmental media are now ubiquitously above guideline levels.",False,2023-03-15T08:32:44,2023-11-21T08:29:41,1.0,10.0,[908]
83,1,F-2021-123,PFAS in food packaging,"Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are industrial chemicals that are used in numerous industrial processes and consumer products, such as fire extinguishing materials. They are also popular in food packaging because the substances are water and fat repellent. However, in animal studies, some of them have been shown to be liver-damaging, toxic to reproduction and probably carcinogenic. PFAS are of particular concern because, unlike other common contaminants that pass quickly through the human body, they can linger for years and thus accumulate cumulatively. This property has given them the name ""forever chemicals"". PFASs can also enter the food chain through environmental pollution, for example when plants are supplied with contaminated water or grown in contaminated soil, such as near factories or places where products containing PFASs have been used for firefighting. From mid-2020, Denmark will be the first country to ban the use of all PFASs in food packaging.",False,2021-06-17T00:00:00,2023-11-28T10:46:43,1.0,22.0,[908]
150,1,F-2022-298,Artificial sweeteners influence microbiome,"New research shows that common artificial sweeteners can cause previously healthy gut bacteria to become sick and invade the gastrointestinal wall, potentially leading to serious health problems. The study by Shil and Chichger (2021) , published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, is the first to show the pathogenic effects of some of the most commonly used artificial sweeteners, saccharin, sucralose and aspartame, on two types of gut bacteria, E. coli (Escherichia coli) and E. faecalis (Enterococcus faecalis). Previous studies have shown that artificial sweeteners can change the number and type of bacteria in the gut, but this new molecular research, led by scientists at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), has shown that sweeteners can also make the bacteria pathogenic. It was found that these pathogenic bacteria can attach to, invade, and kill Caco-2 cells, the epithelial cells that line the gastrointestinal wall. It is known that bacteria such as E. faecalis that cross the intestinal wall can enter the bloodstream and accumulate in the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen, causing a range of infections including septicaemia. In this new study, it was found that at concentrations equivalent to two cans of diet soft drink, all three artificial sweeteners significantly increased the adhesion of E. coli and E. faecalis to intestinal Caco-2 cells and differentially increased the formation of biofilms (Eurek Alert).The substance D-allulose belongs to the group of simple sugars (monosaccharides).The specific risk of favouring human pathogenic bacteria in the human body by food ingredients is to be considered as a possible ""emerging risk"". Aspartame, an artificial sweetener, has been repeatedly criticised for not being safe. This thesis has been taken up in various studies and examined by means of meta-analyses. The authors Millstone and Dawson conclude that it is premature to call aspartame 'safe' because the studies conducted by the EFSA to assess aspartame are flawed.Concerns are also raised concerning the sweetener D-allulose. The sweetness of D-allulose corresponds to about 70% of the sweeteness of household sugar (sucrose), but leads to a significantly lower calorie intake, which is why the substance is advertised as a sugar substitute. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has yet to issue an opinion on the safety of D-allulose as a novel food. The BfR (German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment) reported that the use of D-allulose as a food ingredient could selectively promote the growth of bacteria of the Klebsiella genus, such as K. pneumoniae, in the human body. From a risk assessment perspective, the extent to which regular consumption of previously uncommon amounts of D-allulose as a novel food will undesirably influence the occurrence of Klebsiella spp. in the human gut microbiome remains to be scientifically determined.",True,2022-05-31T00:00:00,2023-10-17T07:41:23,1.0,23.0,[938]
42,1,F-2019-062,Bacillus cereus sensu lato - Bacillus thuringiensis,"In agriculture, bacteria of the genus Bacillus are increasingly used as biocides or plant protection products respectively. B. thuringiensis in particular is used as an insecticide as these bacteria produce Bt toxins. The Bacillus cereus group (Bacillus cereus sensu lato) consists of the B. cereus sensu stricto, B. anthracis, B. thuringiensis, B. weihenstephanensis, B. mycoides, B. pseudomycoides, B. cytotoxicus, and B. toyonensis species. B. cereus and B. thuringiensis genotypically hardly differ. Furthermore, in clinical diagnostics, these species are not differentiated; therefore, it is unclear to what extent B. thuringiensis could have an impact on food-associated intoxications. The greatest difference between the two species is limited to the presence or absence of plasmids. Plasmids often code exotoxins. The mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer would enable a plasmid exchange in the Bacillus cereus sensu lato group. Whether and how this happens has not been closely investigated yet. Thus, whether B. thuringiensis can be detected in food samples has also not been investigated in greater detail. Recently, certain strain of B. thuringiensis was described as being able to produce large amounts of sphingomyelinase; several other strains of B. thuringiensis demonstrated cytotoxicity in vero cell assays. Therefore, these strains have to be potentially considered virulent. The investigated strains were all isolated from biocides. The safety of strains (QPS or GRAS) employed in agriculture is not explicitly demonstrated. In general, precise identification and characterisation of the strains used, in particular of B. thuringiensis and of possible virulence factors, are not available.",True,2019-07-11T00:00:00,2023-10-23T10:37:45,1.0,28.0,[912]
238,1,F-2023-021,The use of AI in food production and food safety,"The Global Food and Retail Managing director of British Standards International stressed during a Forum that there are three major areas of consideration where caution is needed regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in food production. These are : bias and discriminations linked to the data used, privacy and security, and finally how AI-led world would impact people's lives.",False,2023-07-12T06:56:16,2023-11-28T11:48:29,2.0,15.0,[932]
