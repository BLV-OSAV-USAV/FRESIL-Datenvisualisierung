187,4,F-2022-343,Herbs and spices - fraudulent manipulations,"Culinary herbs and spices are valued for flavouring food and could also provide other beneficial properties, such as antioxidative and bacteriostatic effects as well as certain pharmacological activities. Their supply chain is complex, long, and globalised. Europe is one of the world’s leading importing regions for herbs and spices, importing approximately 300.000 tons, mostly spices from East Asia. Most of the spices are produced in countries where certain post-harvest processes such as drying and cleaning may happen before being shipped to the importing country where they are further cleaned and sanitised before being packaged and distributed either to other food businesses or for retail consumption. At each stage, fraudulent manipulations may happen and the more often the material is transferred from one operator to the next, the fraud opportunity increases",False,2022-05-02T00:00:00,2022-09-12T13:16:19,1.5,3.0,"[270, 349, 161, 198]"
93,2,F-2021-133,"Cannabinoids CBD,CBG,CBN,Δ-8 THC in foods","Foods containing extracts of hemp or cannabinoids (such as CBD) represent the current trend in Switzerland (FSVO, leaflet). The product range containing CBD includes various product categories, which are mainly sold on the internet. CBD, unlike THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), is not subject to the Federal Act on Narcotics (BetmG, SR 812.121) because it has no similar psychoactive effect. However, cannabinoids and hemp extracts are essentially novel foods, which is why they cannot be added to food as one pleases. In the USA, for a long time, the FDA had classified CBD as GRAS ('generally recognised as safe'), i.e. as a food additive, the substance was deemed to be harmless. However, this classification has now been revised and the FDA warns of possible side effects, such as liver damage, interactions with other drugs, fatigue, diarrhea and mood swings. Cannabigerol (CBG) is - similar to CBD - a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found in various cannabis species. It has a relaxing effect but does not cause drowsiness; instead, it has an energising effect. CBG is thought to have medicinal potential, for example as an anti-inflammatory or when treating pain and nausea. However, cannabinoid research has not progressed enough to support the definitive treatment potential of cannabinoids. The FOPH writes: ""Regarding the effects attributed to CBD, research is still in its infancy and it is quite impossible to confirm or deny its effects and its usefulness for clinical practice. In general, it remains to be said that its efficacy is claimed to be more promising than what has been proven, but CBD is likely to be effective for certain symptoms and disorders"".In its 2019 European Food Trends Report, the GDI states that the market for 'drinkables' and 'edibles' - foods and beverages containing cannabis - is booming. Other cannabinoids are entering the market, such as cannabigerol (CBG) . CBD is the hype of the decade - according to New Food 2020 - but with the market for cannabidiol oversaturated in the U.S., product companies will introduce other cannabinoids such as cannabinol (CBN) and cannabigerol (CBG), which are said to have functional benefits regarding sleep and appetite manipulation. According to Food News, the FDA is expected to voice its concerns about these 'cannabis-derived compounds'. However, it is still expected that they will be marketed. Inquiries about this have already reached the FSVO. Since CBD is currently becoming a trend product and is offered in various forms (as drops, as food ingredient, in cosmetics, etc.), it is quite possible that other cannabinoids such as CBG will also become popular in the future. In Ireland, poisoning in children has occured 1) after the consumption of sweets (Ir Med J Vol. 2021 Vol.114, No. 8 p446). It is also suspected that synthetic cannabinoids were used. Hence, synthetic cannabinoids are likely to pose a new risk.",True,2021-07-19T00:00:00,2023-10-20T09:03:24,1.0,41.0,"[467, 32]"
230,2,F-2023-013,Grayanotoxin in honey,"The European Commission asked EFSA for a scientific opinion on the risks for human health of the presence of grayanotoxins (GTXs) in ‘certain honey’ from Ericaceae plants. The risk assessment included all structurally related grayananes occurring with GTXs in ‘certain’ honey. Oral exposure is associated with acute intoxication in humans. Acute symptoms affect the muscles, nervous and cardiovascular systems. These may lead to complete atrioventricular block, convulsions, mental confusion, agitation, syncope and respiratory depression. For acute effects, the CONTAM Panel derived a reference point (RP) of 15.3 μg/kg body weight for the sum of GTX I and III based on a BMDL10 for reduced heart rate in rats. A similar relative potency was considered for GTX I. Without chronic toxicity studies, an RP for long-term effects could not be derived. There is evidence for genotoxicity in mice exposed to GTX III or honey containing GTX I and III, showing increased levels of chromosomal damage. The mechanism of genotoxicity is unknown. Without representative occurrence data for the sum of GTX I and III and consumption data from Ericaceae honey, acute dietary exposure was estimated based on selected concentrations for GTX I and III reflecting concentrations measured in ‘certain’ honeys. Applying a margin of exposure (MOE) approach, the estimated MOEs raised health concerns for acute toxicity. The Panel calculated the highest concentrations for GTX I and III below which no acute effects would be expected following ‘certain honey’ consumption. The Panel is 75% or more certain that the calculated highest concentration of 0.05 mg for the sum of GTX I and III per kg honey is protective for all age groups regarding acute intoxications. This value does not consider other grayananes in ‘certain honey’ and does not cover the identified genotoxicity.",False,2023-03-06T09:24:30,2023-03-06T14:49:36,2.0,4.0,"[379, 225]"

The ubiquity of social media has created new opportunities for qualified or accredited experts from the scientific community to connect with customers and the public. It has also created challenges. Health and wellness gurus, or self-proclaimed experts, use social media platforms to attract attention with compelling narratives, build an audience and influence public opinion by sharing (often) misleading information about food and nutrition. This can result in the perpetuation of misinformation, which not only undermines the proper functioning of democracy, but also diminishes support for science-based or evidence-based policies. In addition, ephemeral types of content that attract the attention of a large audience (trends) can quickly spread across major social media platforms and be replicated by more or less aware users.

They are the main cause of bacterial diseases caused by seafood. These pathogens are regularly detected in the USA and Asia. In Europe, the pathogen is hardly ever found. There are fears that these pathogens will become increasingly important as the oceans warm up. The severity of the diseases caused by V. vulnificus can be described as very severe. According to literature, the lethality rate is over 50% after infection. This makes it one of the most serious pathogens in terms of lethality in the area of food-borne diseases. The FDA regulation expresses this with a zero tolerance. In the EU and Switzerland, there is no regulation of this pathogen. In addition, various publications report the multiple development of antibiotic resistance in these pathogens, caused by the use of antibiotics in aquacultures. Environmental and patient isolates show similar resistance profiles. These included resistance to ampicillin, penicillin and tetracycline.

180,1,F-2022-336,Nano coating of foods,"There is currently a lot of investment in research to develop new types of food packaging and a trend towards sustainable and also edible forms of packaging. Edible packaging is usually made of sustainable, biodegradable material. On the one hand, this includes packaging such as yoghurt pots that can be eaten, but also edible coatings that are placed around the food. In Switzerland, edible coatings of fruits and some vegetables are permitted, e.g. beeswax (E 901) as a coating for apples. Provided that the substances are approved as food additives for the respective food. What is new is that more and more packaging or coating agents are now being developed in nano form. Depending on the application, these are nanofibres, nanoparticles, nanoemulsions or even nanoencapsulations. A current example is the development of a nano-cellulose layer for fruits and vegetables, which is made from pomace (pressed out fruit and vegetable peels). The project is a collaboration between Lidl and researchers at EMPA. The reason for using nano-forms is manifold. Nano-form coatings allow thin edible layers on the food (about 5nm thickness). Coatings based on nanotechnology usually also allow better regulation of moisture in the food and better gas exchange for longer shelf life. In addition, nanocoatings can enable other functions such as the incorporation of so-called nanosensors in food, which indicate the spoilage of food (so-called ""smart packaging""). Various legal and health issues arise in the application. For example, in the case of the cellulose developed by EMPA, it is not clear whether the already approved coating agents (celluloses E 460-469) cover the newly developed cellulose or whether it would need a new approval. Secondly, there are questions about the toxicity of the nanoparticles through the consumption of the edible layers, which need to be carefully clarified before new nanoforms can be put on the market. A report by the RIVM in the Netherlands, for example, points out that specific risk assessments are needed for nanocellulose applications in the food sector, and that these might even have to be considered as novel foods. Retailers and Empa (Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology) are researching protective cellulose coating for fruit and vegetable products. The innovative coating is made from so-called pomace (press residue) and in the future, is to be used for retailers' products. The innovative project can reduce packaging and avoid food waste. No fresh vegetables are to be used for the novel protective coating, only organic residues. At Empa's Cellulose & Wood Materials lab, commissioned by a retailer, researchers developed a special protective cellulose layer that can be applied to fruit and vegetables within a year's time. The result: the coated fruits and vegetables stay significantly longer fresh. In tests, for example, the shelf life of bananas could be extended by more than a week.Other materials for alternative packaging and substitutes for plastics are being researched, including silk, for example.",True,2022-03-16T00:00:00,2023-10-05T06:54:59,1.0,23.0,[185]

Platforms offer consumers the possibility of having their food delivered and ready-to-eat by the restaurant of their choice, whereby different people in the same household can have a wide variety of dishes delivered to their home at the same time (e.g., smood.ch). Another option is to go eat at someone's place who offers their services on an internet platform (e.g., de.eatwith.com); yet another option is to have someone cook for you at home (e.g., deinkoch.ch). There are numerous delivery platforms, such as: Uber Eats, Deliveroo, Blue Apron, Amazon restaurants, GrubHub, Eat street, just eat, etc. In contrast to already existing offers, 'ghost kitchens' are establishing themselves, which uniquely produce on an industrial scale for delivery services and deliver to customers. A dining room with guests is no longer needed. Production and delivery can be industrialised using robots and drones. Bank analysts assume that there is great growth potential. Some providers go even further, they try to no longer use packaging materials.
