Understanding the survival duration of L. monocytogenes in specific water sources is important, but studies are limited concerning this environment and the impact of these highly variable factors.

In 2021, a study by the US Environmental Working Group (EWG), analysing data from Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast), showed that the preservative TBHQ is harmful to the immune system, based on both animal studies and in vitro toxicology studies. This finding is particularly worrying in the time of the coronavirus pandemic.

Several studies suggest thatQAACs co-select for antibiotic resistant microorganisms and thus may contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistancein the environment. Data on QAAC occurrence in soil are scarce and limited to soils that are prone to direct exposure toQAACs. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive study on the occurrence of QAACs in soils of Hesse, a federal statein Germany, covering an area of 21,115 km2. Sixty-five soil samples that comprised different land uses (arable, grass-land, forest, vineyard) and area types (rural, agglomeration) were analysed for concentrations ofalkyltrimethylammonium (ATMACs, with alkyl chain lengths C8-C16), benzylalkyldimethylammonium (BACs, C8-C18) and dialkyldimethylammonium compounds (DADMACs, C8-C18) via HPLC-MS/MS after ultrasonic-assisted ex-traction with acidified acetonitrile. QAACs were detected in 97 % of the soil samples irrespective of land use and areatype. The most abundant QAAC homologues were DADMACs > BACs > ATMACs. The highest total QAAC concentra-tions were detected in alluvial soils influenced by the deposition of suspended particles during flood events, withDADMAC-C16 and -C18 as the dominant homologues. The high abundance of long-chain DADMACs suggests that leg-acy pollution and accumulation govern QAAC concentrations in soils. The presence of QAACs in forest soils points to apotential input via atmospheric deposition. Our work highlights the widespread occurrence of QAACs in soils of Hesseand the need for more research on their entry paths and fate in the soil ecosystem.#Might have - beside other quaternary ammonium compounds - impact into drinking water safety and soil dependent vegetable cultures#True#0#False##20#2023-04-04T06:48:04#971#2023-04-04T11:06:48#932#2#2023-04-04#06:48:04#2023-04-04#11:06:48

Testbiotech stresses the fact that these changes could have negative impacts on health and the environment beyond what is known from conventional breeding.#Testbiotech has criticized an EU Commission services discussion paper intended to identify criteria for deregulating some genetically engineered plants.

Prime Hydration and Prime Energy have become popular in Norway, especially among children and young people, in a short time. Officials are concerned that added vitamins, minerals, caffeine, or other substances in the beverages may pose a health risk for consumers. Certain quantities of vitamins, minerals, and other substances can be added to various foods and beverages. If they are not already permitted, the business must apply for approval. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority then assesses whether the added items may pose a health risk before a permit is granted. The agency said so far it has not received applications from importers with the necessary information about Prime products. Some flavors have a higher caffeine content than is permitted under current regulations. Others have a high amount of vitamin A, which people can get in sufficient quantities from other foods. Excessive intake of vitamin A over a long period can damage the liver. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority said importers are responsible for the safety of goods they bring into the country and must ensure products meet the relevant regulations. In Denmark, the sale of such products without notification is not allowed. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (Fødevarestyrelsen) said it has found Prime drinks illegally sold online via websites such as Facebook. The agency recently banned sales of the drinks from five registered and unregistered companies. Efforts are part of an ongoing control campaign, where companies’ sales of items that include added vitamins, minerals or certain other substances are being checked. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration said it had been approached by parents who asked if the drink was safe for their children. If Prime products have added substances or amounts of additives that are not pre-approved, then they must go through an approval process but authorities said this hasn’t happened. If the drinks comply with the rules for added quantities, importers can register them so they can be legally sold in Denmark.#The product may be found/sold also in Switzerland: Buy Prime Hydration Products Online at Best Prices | Ubuy Switzerland (u-buy.ch)#True#1#False##20#2023-05-17T07:36:14#84#2023-05-23T08:13:40#932#1#2023-05-17#07:36:14#2023-05-23#08:13:40

841#N-2023-623#Toxigenic Vibrio cholerae strains in South-East Queensland, Australian river waterways#Cholera is a major public health problem in developing and underdeveloped countries; however, it remains of concern to developed countries such as Australia as international travel-related or locally acquired cholera or diarrheal disease cases are still reported. Cholera is mainly caused by cholera toxin (CT) producing toxigenic O1 and O139 serogroup Vibrio cholerae strains. While most toxigenic V. cholerae cases in Australia are thought to be caused by international-acquired infections, Australia has its own indigenous toxigenic and non-toxigenic O1 and non-O1, non-O139 V. cholerae (NOVC) strains. In Australia, in the 1970s and again in 2012, it was reported that south-east Queensland riverways were a reservoir for toxigenic V. cholerae strains that were linked to local cases. Further surveillance on environmental reservoirs, such as riverways, has not been reported in the literature in the last 10 years. Here we present data from sites previously related to outbreaks and surveillance sampling to detect the presence of V. cholerae using PCR in conjunction with MALDI-TOF and whole-genome sequencing. In this study, we were able to detect NOVC at all 10 sites with all sites having toxigenic non-O1, non-O139 strains. Among 133 NOVC isolates, 22 were whole-genome sequenced and compared with previously sequenced Australian O1 and NOVC strains. None of the samples tested grew toxigenic or non-toxigenic O1 or O139, responsible for epidemic disease. Since NOVC can be pathogenic, continuous surveillance is required to assist in theclinical and envir rapid identification of sources of any outbreaks and to assist public health authorities in implementing control measures.##True#2#False##20#2023-10-09T07:47:19#84#2023-10-11T16:40:23#932#1#2023-10-09#07:47:19#2023-10-11#16:40:23
