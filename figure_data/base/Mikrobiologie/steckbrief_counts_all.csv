The rate resulting from 8.2 new cases reported per 100,000 inhabitants is the highest rate since the obligation to report was introduced in 1999. As in the previous year, most cases were registered in the third quarter. The age group of children under 5 years continued to show the highest rate of 16.0 per 100,000 inhabitants reported and accounted for 10% of reported VTEC cases. (source: Zoonosis Report 2018). This increase was already discussed in 2015, and at that time, this was attributed to the spread of new diagnostic methods (FOPH, 2015).

The focus of virus-associated outbreaks has so far been on noroviruses (NV) and hepatitis A. In recent years, the importance of diseases with hepatitis E (HEV) has also increased, as a result of which Switzerland subsequently launched a reporting obligation for HEV diseases. Globally, NV is the most common cause of gastrointestinal diseases. Most outbreaks are due to contaminated leafy vegetables, fresh fruit and shellfish. Due to global trade, viruses from endemic areas are also expected to spread. Recent example: HAV outbreak in the EU associated with products from Morocco. The detection of viruses in food is a challenge because the isolation of viruses from complex food matrices is complex, the viruses are heterogeneously distributed and sometimes occur in minute quantities. By means of thermal treatment, food-relevant viruses such as NV, HAV and HEV can be efficiently inactivated, even in complex foods such as shellfish.

Recently, certain strain of B. thuringiensis was described as being able to produce large amounts of sphingomyelinase; several other strains of B. thuringiensis demonstrated cytotoxicity in vero cell assays.

Scientific investigations have been conducted to explore detailed information on the establishment of the human gut microbiome, the functioning of the microbiome, the succession of the microbiome, factors influencing microbial community dynamics and the role of the gut microbiome in health and disease. Extensive research has suggested microbiome therapeutics as a futuristic medicine for various physiological and metabolic disorders. A comprehensive review of microbial colonisation, host-microbe interactions, microbial adaptation, commensal selection and immune survivability is still required to catalogue the essential genetic and physiological features for commensal engagement. The evolution of a structured human gut microbiome relies on microbial flexibility for genetic, immunological and physiological adaptation in the human gut. The key features for commensalism could be used in the development of a tailored microbiome-based therapy to overcome various physiological and metabolic disorders.The influence of the gut microbiome on human health has come increasingly into focus in recent years. The microbiome in the gut has an important function in the metabolism of food components and chemicals and also serves as a barrier against harmful effects from the environment. The microbiome is a highly diverse community of microorganisms and includes bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses. Ongoing studies show that microbiome structure and dynamics can have both a direct (e.g., direct metabolic conversion of chemicals) and indirect (e.g., regulation of gut barrier function) impact on human and animal health. The microbiome structure and dynamics are in turn influenced by external influences, such as food or chemicals. There are now a number of studies showing an effect of additives such as artificial sweeteners or emulsifiers on the microbiome, often resulting in impaired glucose metabolism or gut inflammation (Laudisi et al. 2019, Roca-Saavedra et al. 2018). There is evidence from studies with mice that emulsifiers, for example, can disrupt gut homeostasis and lead to inflammation in the gut (Chassaing et al. 2015).

For meat, the most direct route of Clostridioides difficile contamination is via faeces during slaughter, but post-production processing could also play a role. The main sources of contamination of vegetables are soil or indirect faecal contamination through irrigation or fertilisation. Hand contamination during handling of meat and vegetables is also possible. The study found that the proportion of Clostridioides difficile-positive meat and vegetable samples is increasing every year.

Serum samples from 409 ostriches (Struthio camelus) collected from 9 farms were analysed by latex agglutination test. Antibodies against T. gondii were detected in 149 (36 %) animals. High seropositivity may, according to Bàrtovà et al., indicate a risk of infection from ostrich meat to humans. Brain and heart tissues appear to be suitable samples for PCR detection of T. gondii DNA. Ostriches can presumably react as serological non-responders to T. gondii infection. Bàrtov et al. suggest that ostriches may pose a high risk of toxoplasmosis to humans by consuming raw or inadequately cooked ostrich meat and that even seronegative ostriches may harbour T. gondii in their tissues.",2021-08-10T00:00:00,2023-10-19T08:26:01,1.5,4.0,"[144, 248]"

These products include vegetables and fruits that are ready to eat or can be prepared with minimal effort (e.g. heating). Such products also find their way into smoothies, where a variety of different fruits and vegetables are processed. Numerous outbreaks involving such products have been reported internationally. The range of possible pathogens includes:

Viral pathogens: NoV on raspberries, cherry tomatoes; HAV on dates, frozen pomegranate seeds.
Bacterial pathogens: salmonella on melons, basil, coconuts; STEC on lettuce; listeria on pre-cut vegetables
Parasitic pathogens: cyclospora on pre-cut vegetables; crypotosporidia in smoothies.

For example, from 2015 to 2018, an outbreak related to frozen ready-to-eat vegetables was ongoing. The source of this outbreak could be identified. In addition to frozen maize, other frozen vegetables have also been affected. 47 cases and 9 deaths have been linked to the outbreak. As a result, there have been global recalls of frozen vegetables, with thousands of tonnes destroyed. In the UK alone, more than 50 products were affected. Recalls were also issued in Switzerland. It was striking that listeriosis was caused in frozen products that were not ready for consumption. The question arises as to what the reasons for the listerioses were. The question arises: how can listerioses develop from frozen products that are not ready to eat? Is this a question of inadequate heating instructions (e.g. microwave: too few watts, too short thermal exposure, no homogeneous heating) or a question of production?

It can also determine the response to cancer therapies and predict disease progression and survival (Jain et al., 2021). There is vast literature on the beneficial effects of probiotics for the prevention and treatment of cancer. A review of the available literature on the subject was published in 2022. The authors conclude that probiotics have been shown to be effective against various types of cancer, but also that there is a need to evaluate the adverse effects of probiotics (gastrointestinal side effects, skin reactions, access to antibiotic resistance genes, harmful effects of metabolites, abnormal stimulation of the immune system) (Sankarapandian et al., 2022). Cancer patients have compromised immunity due to primary disease, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The effects of probiotics in this population may differ from those in healthy individuals and raise several critical issues (Lu et al., 2021). A new publication states that Lactobacillus can alter the function of immune cells (macrophages) in the pancreatic tumour environment and stimulate cancer growth (Hezaveh et al., 2022). The mechanism involves the metabolisation of dietary tryptophan by bacteria in the gut, which leads to an inactivation of immune cells involved in tumour control. This is not the only indication of potentially harmful effects of probiotic microorganisms, even independently of the presence of cancer. Among others:

Although probiotic bacteria are generally recognised as safe (GRAS status), there are several reports of side effects triggered by the presence of these organisms: systemic infections, impact on the immune system, disruption of metabolism and horizontal gene transfer (Zawistowska-Rojek and Tyski, 2018).
Brain fog syndrome has been reported to be related to probiotic use, with symptoms improving with antibiotics and probiotic discontinuation (Rao et al., 2018).
Fungemia and other fungal infections have been associated with the use of probiotic supplements based on Saccharomyces boulardii (Rannikko et al., 2021).

This group comprises closely related organisms of varying pathogenicity including the food-borne pathogen Bacillus cereus sensu stricto. Some members of the B. cereus group can cause two distinct forms of food-borne illness: Firstly, the diarrheal syndrome that is linked to three enterotoxins - Hbl, Nhe and CytK - and secondly, the emetic syndrome caused by cereulide toxin preformed in food. B. cytotoxicus was isolated for the first time in the context of a severe outbreak of diarrheal disease leading to fatalities and was described as a species in 2013. The organism harbors a specific variant of the gene encoding the enterotoxin cytotoxin K designated cytK-1. It has been reported that the cytotoxin K variant CytK-1 confers substantially higher toxicity than CytK-2. B. cytotoxicus is thermotolerant and might be missed using routine diagnostic screening for B. cereus group organisms at 30°C. Targeted screening at temperatures of at least 37°C has shown that dried food matrices containing potato starch very commonly harbor B. cytotoxicus.For instance, a recent study found a prevalence of 95% in mashed potato powder sold at retail level in Switzerland. Recent reports from the UK suggest that B. cytotoxicus also occurs in association with insect-based foods, which have recently gained popularity. In cytotoxicity assays, the few B. cytotoxicus strains that have been characterized to date range from non-toxic to extremely toxic, with toxicity surpassing the toxicity of a B. cereus outbreak strain (NVH 0075-95) used as a reference. Information on B. cytotoxicus is still limited and it is unclear if the organism’s capacity to germinate, produce enterotoxins, and exhibit cytotoxic effects in the intestine is comparable to that of B. cereus.B. cytotoxicus is a Gram-positive, aerobic organism able to produce spores. The species description was based on five strains, four of which were linked to foodborne disease (Guinebretière et al., 2013). B. cytotoxicus is thermotolerant and able to grow at temperatures of up to 53°C.

149,2,F-2021-297,ESKAPE pathogens transmission via food,"ESKAPE is an acronym that encompasses the scientific names of six highly virulent and antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens, including: Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp. This group of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria can evade or 'escape' common antibiotics due to their increasing multi-drug resistance (MDR). As a result, they are the leading cause of life-threatening nosocomial or hospital-acquired infections in immunocompromised and critically ill patients worldwide, who are most at risk. The food chain is one of the main drivers of MDR transmission, as food is not sterile and can usually have microbiological contamination or become contaminated at certain stages of the food chain (i.e. cross-contamination, recontamination). Indeed, the food chain can act as a driver for MDR spread, enabling the survival or even multiplication of MDR pathogens. MDR transmission is not exclusive to foods of animal origin or fish; plant foods can also harbour MDR microorganisms, as vegetables can be contaminated during primary production by water contaminated with faecal material from wastewater from surrounding farms. In general, pathogens are not common in food and the main risk arises from the high prevalence of non-pathogenic microorganisms that can transfer AMR genes to other microbial species, including foodborne pathogens. It is well documented that genes encoding resistance are transferable between different bacteria in farm animals and also from them to bacteria in food and humans by horizontal gene transfer (i.e. transformation, conjugation and transduction).",2021-09-21T00:00:00,2023-09-18T07:41:56,2.0,9.0,"[923, 922]"

With this purpose, more effective antimicrobial compounds of natural origin such as bacteriocins, bacteriophages and essential oils have been preferred over synthetic ones and new encapsulation strategies such as emulsions, core-shell nanofibres, cyclodextrins and liposomes among others, have been applied in order to protect these antimicrobials from degradation or volatilization while trying to enable a more controlled release and sustained antimicrobial action. This trend brought new challenges regarding the incorporation of these new products into these novel packaging materials in terms of antimicrobial-packaging material compatibilities and, the most important one, the decreased stability of these natural-based compounds as they are more prone to suffer degradation by heat and light.

Infected animals often show no symptoms, but excrete the pathogen mainly via birth products of farm animals (e.g. placenta), which are usually highly infectious, but also via faeces, urine or milk. In the majority of cases, infection in humans occurs through inhalation of dust containing the pathogen, but also through direct contact with infected animals. People who are in close contact with animals (animal owners, veterinarians, slaughterhouse employees, etc.) are particularly affected. Depending on the wind conditions, however, people in the immediate vicinity of infected animals can also become infected. In about half of the people infected, the infection causes no symptoms or only mild flu-like symptoms that disappear spontaneously. The other half experience sudden fever, chills, sweating, fatigue and headache, which can be complicated by inflammation of the lungs, liver, heart muscle or brain.

Over 30 different species are responsible for this, but the species Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) is the most common. Azoles, mainly triazoles, are used to prevent or treat Aspergillus spp. infections in humans and plants. Resistance of Aspergillus usually results from long-term treatments with triazoles. However, A. fumigatus has been isolated from patients who have never been treated with such drugs. It is therefore suspected that resistant strains spread in the environment. These strains may have acquired their resistance through the use of triazole-based fungicides. Azole resistance is therefore described as an emerging problem. In Germany, an increased number of aspergilloses have been observed in the last 5 years. In agriculture, resistance to Aspergillus also seems to be increasing, probably due to changes in cultivation techniques (minimum tillage) which may promote contamination and the growth of Aspergillus. Another risk is the emergence of cross-resistance.

180,1,F-2022-336,Nano coating of foods,"There is currently a lot of investment in research to develop new types of food packaging and a trend towards sustainable and also edible forms of packaging. Edible packaging is usually made of sustainable, biodegradable material. On the one hand, this includes packaging such as yoghurt pots that can be eaten, but also edible coatings that are placed around the food. In Switzerland, edible coatings of fruits and some vegetables are permitted, e.g. beeswax (E 901) as a coating for apples. Provided that the substances are approved as food additives for the respective food. What is new is that more and more packaging or coating agents are now being developed in nano form. Depending on the application, these are nanofibres, nanoparticles, nanoemulsions or even nanoencapsulations. A current example is the development of a nano-cellulose layer for fruits and vegetables, which is made from pomace (pressed out fruit and vegetable peels). The project is a collaboration between Lidl and researchers at EMPA. The reason for using nano-forms is manifold. Nano-form coatings allow thin edible layers on the food (about 5nm thickness). Coatings based on nanotechnology usually also allow better regulation of moisture in the food and better gas exchange for longer shelf life. In addition, nanocoatings can enable other functions such as the incorporation of so-called nanosensors in food, which indicate the spoilage of food (so-called ""smart packaging""). Various legal and health issues arise in the application. For example, in the case of the cellulose developed by EMPA, it is not clear whether the already approved coating agents (celluloses E 460-469) cover the newly developed cellulose or whether it would need a new approval. Secondly, there are questions about the toxicity of the nanoparticles through the consumption of the edible layers, which need to be carefully clarified before new nanoforms can be put on the market. A report by the RIVM in the Netherlands, for example, points out that specific risk assessments are needed for nanocellulose applications in the food sector, and that these might even have to be considered as novel foods. Retailers and Empa (Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology) are researching protective cellulose coating for fruit and vegetable products. The innovative coating is made from so-called pomace (press residue) and in the future, is to be used for retailers' products. The innovative project can reduce packaging and avoid food waste. No fresh vegetables are to be used for the novel protective coating, only organic residues. At Empa's Cellulose & Wood Materials lab, commissioned by a retailer, researchers developed a special protective cellulose layer that can be applied to fruit and vegetables within a year's time. The result: the coated fruits and vegetables stay significantly longer fresh. In tests, for example, the shelf life of bananas could be extended by more than a week.Other materials for alternative packaging and substitutes for plastics are being researched, including silk, for example.",2022-03-16T00:00:00,2023-10-05T06:54:59,2.0,23.0,[147]
24,1,F-2019-044,"Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE, syn. FSME)","TBE or tick-borne encephalitis (encephalitis = inflammation of the brain) is an infectious disease caused by the TBE virus. The virus is transmitted by the bite of an infected tick (Castor bean tick). This is the most significant way of transmitting the virus. An alimentary transmission by unpasteurised milk, or milk products from acutely infected goats or cattle was reported on and has been discussed repeatedly in the past. In Germany, two outbreaks, caused by alimentary transmissions, were detected in 2016 and 2017 respectively. TBE is a viral infection caused by one in three tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis).",2019-01-30T00:00:00,2023-11-18T08:34:42,1.0,31.0,[625]
82,1,F-2019-122,Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) in Enterococci,"Enterococci are widespread and can be found in soils, surface water, vegetation and in fresh and processed foods, especially those of animal origin. Some antibiotic-resistant E. faecium and E. faecalis strains are responsible for an increasing rate of nosocomial infections.Three studies report the identification of a novel botulinum neurotoxin gene cluster (BoNT gene cluster) in the genome of an E. faecium strain. These findings are worrying as E. faecium are widely distributed in terrestrial animals as well as being a core component of human gut flora. There are concerns that botulism neurotoxins could be produced by such Enterococci. In food, BoNTs are produced preferably under low-oxygen conditions by Clostridium botulinum, and food poisoning is usually associated with food that has been inadequately sterilised. This often involves homemade canned vegetables.",2019-11-01T00:00:00,2022-09-06T13:33:27,1.0,3.0,[649]
93,1,F-2021-133,"Cannabinoids CBD,CBG,CBN,Δ-8 THC in foods","Foods containing extracts of hemp or cannabinoids (such as CBD) represent the current trend in Switzerland (FSVO, leaflet). The product range containing CBD includes various product categories, which are mainly sold on the internet. CBD, unlike THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), is not subject to the Federal Act on Narcotics (BetmG, SR 812.121) because it has no similar psychoactive effect. However, cannabinoids and hemp extracts are essentially novel foods, which is why they cannot be added to food as one pleases. In the USA, for a long time, the FDA had classified CBD as GRAS ('generally recognised as safe'), i.e. as a food additive, the substance was deemed to be harmless. However, this classification has now been revised and the FDA warns of possible side effects, such as liver damage, interactions with other drugs, fatigue, diarrhea and mood swings. Cannabigerol (CBG) is - similar to CBD - a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found in various cannabis species. It has a relaxing effect but does not cause drowsiness; instead, it has an energising effect. CBG is thought to have medicinal potential, for example as an anti-inflammatory or when treating pain and nausea. However, cannabinoid research has not progressed enough to support the definitive treatment potential of cannabinoids. The FOPH writes: ""Regarding the effects attributed to CBD, research is still in its infancy and it is quite impossible to confirm or deny its effects and its usefulness for clinical practice. In general, it remains to be said that its efficacy is claimed to be more promising than what has been proven, but CBD is likely to be effective for certain symptoms and disorders"".In its 2019 European Food Trends Report, the GDI states that the market for 'drinkables' and 'edibles' - foods and beverages containing cannabis - is booming. Other cannabinoids are entering the market, such as cannabigerol (CBG) . CBD is the hype of the decade - according to New Food 2020 - but with the market for cannabidiol oversaturated in the U.S., product companies will introduce other cannabinoids such as cannabinol (CBN) and cannabigerol (CBG), which are said to have functional benefits regarding sleep and appetite manipulation. According to Food News, the FDA is expected to voice its concerns about these 'cannabis-derived compounds'. However, it is still expected that they will be marketed. Inquiries about this have already reached the FSVO. Since CBD is currently becoming a trend product and is offered in various forms (as drops, as food ingredient, in cosmetics, etc.), it is quite possible that other cannabinoids such as CBG will also become popular in the future. In Ireland, poisoning in children has occured 1) after the consumption of sweets (Ir Med J Vol. 2021 Vol.114, No. 8 p446). It is also suspected that synthetic cannabinoids were used. Hence, synthetic cannabinoids are likely to pose a new risk.",2021-07-19T00:00:00,2023-10-20T09:03:24,1.0,41.0,[838]

Humans can be infected by the fecal-oral route; most commonly via contaminated water or food treated with it (such as salads, berries, herbs, etc.). In 2017 and 2018, several outbreaks occurred in the United Kingdom and the United States. In each of these outbreaks, numerous people fell ill. As a result, various food products were withdrawn from the market. International companies have also been affected.

79,1,F-2019-119,Arcobacter spp. in foods and water,"Arcobacter butzleri, recently renamed Aliarcobacter butzleri comb. nov., are aerotolerant Campylobacter-like organisms previously classified as Campylobacter. The genus Arcobacter was described in 1992. A. butzleri is found in environmental samples and untreated water appears to be a potential source of infection. In industrialised countries, the most important source of human contamination is food. Indeed, A. butzleri has been isolated in several farmed animals and is found in a variety of retail meats, including chicken, beef, pork, and lamb, with a high prevalence in poultry. Milk and dairy products may also be affected. A. butzleri colonises diverse and numerous ecological niches, such as water sources, ready-to-eat foods like vegetables, and food products of animal origin like meat, milk and cheese, fish and seafood. In addition, its survival and growth has been demonstrated in raw, pasteurised and UHT milk, and in the production and storage of ricotta cheese and artisanal water buffalo mozzarella cheese. These findings have led to A. butzleri being considered one of the emerging pathogens in milk and dairy products/environments of the 21st century (Fusco et al., 2020). Some Arcobacter species can cause gastrointestinal diseases in humans and animals. These are usually associated with abdominal pain and nausea, and watery diarrhoea but can also be asymptomatic. In general, a mild course of disease is observed in humans.",2019-10-23T00:00:00,2023-11-06T06:42:41,3.0,23.0,[50]
179,1,F-2022-335,Staphylococcus argenteus,"Staphylococcus argenteus has recently been proposed as a new species within the S. aureus complex (SAC). S. argenteus has been found in many countries and can pose a threat to human health. It is known to cause various diseases in humans such as skin and soft tissue infections, sepsis and staphylococcal food poisoning. A study by Wakabayashi et al. (2022) investigated the prevalence of S. argenteus in retail fresh food and poultry slaughterhouses in Japan. Of 642 food samples examined, S. argenteus was successfully isolated in 21 of 151 (13.9 %) chicken samples. No isolations were confirmed from pork, beef, fish or vegetable samples in retail markets.The findings of Wakabayashi et al. (2022) suggested that chicken meat was significantly contaminated with this bacterium and could be a source of human disease. The molecular epidemiological study by Wakabayashi et al. (2022) found that meat processing plants could be partly responsible for the spread of the bacterium from the environment to food and vice versa.Staphylococcus argenteus has been recently established as a novel species of the Staphylococcus aureus complex. It is known to cause various human diseases, such as skin and soft-tissue infections, sepsis, and staphylococcal food poisoning, although the source of infection has not been clearly described. In food poisoning cases, the source of bacterial contamination in food is unknown.

Staphylococcus argenteus was isolated from chicken meat and slaughterhouse samples.


Twenty-one isolates from chicken meat were classified into 14 genotypes.
Sequence type 2250, a clone spreading globally, was not a predominant genotype.
WGS showed possible bacterial contamination of chicken meat in the slaughterhouse.

117,1,F-2021-233,Soybean oil - cause of neurological diseases,"The consumption of soybean oil has increased dramatically over the last fifty years and is associated with obesity and diabetes. To test the hypothesis that soybean oil diets alter hypothalamic gene expression in relation to metabolic phenotype, the research group below performed RNA sequencing analysis with male mice that were fed isocaloric, high-fat diets based on conventional soybean oil (high in linoleic acid, LA), a genetically modified low-LA soybean oil (plenish) and coconut oil (high in saturated fat, without LA). Both soybean oil diets had similar but not identical effects on the hypothalamic transcriptome, while the coconut oil diet had a negligible effect compared to a low-fat control diet. Dysregulated genes were associated with inflammation, neuroendocrine, neurochemical and insulin signalling. Oxt was the only gene with metabolic, inflammatory, and neurological relevance that was upregulated by both soybean oil diets compared to both control diets. Oxytocin immunoreactivity in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus was reduced, while plasma oxytocin and hypothalamic Oxt were increased. These central and peripheral effects of the soybean oil diet correlated with glucose intolerance but not with body weight. In the coconut oil diet enriched with stigmasterol, a phytosterol derived from soybean oil, changes in hypothalamic Oxt and plasma oxytocin were not observed. The research team discovered about 100 other genes that are also affected by the soybean oil diet. They believe that this discovery could have implications not only for the energy metabolism, but also for important brain functions and diseases such as autism and Parkinson's disease. However, it has been indicated that there is no evidence that the oil causes these diseases. Furthermore, the team noted that the findings only applied to soybean oil - not to other soy products or other vegetable oils.",2021-01-05T00:00:00,2023-02-07T09:11:19,1.0,12.0,[687]

The bacteria have been detected in fish, but also in insects and domestic and farm animals, and can cause gastroenteritis and diarrhea in humans.

85,1,F-2019-125,Nitrite in meat products,"The World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) 2007 stated that the consumption of processed meat may be linked to colorectal cancer. The cause is said to be nitrite curing salt, which is added to many products to prevent the growth of food spoilage bacteria, especially Clostridium botulinum. Several studies have investigated this hypothesis but have come to different conclusions. A connection between high nitrite intake from meat products and an increased cancer risk can neither be clearly proven nor disproven. Moreover, it is not only the consumption of a food that plays a role in the development of the disease, but the interaction between all lifestyle habits such as diet, exercise, alcohol and cigarette consumption, etc. Nitrite is not only absorbed through cured meat products, but is also formed as a degradation product of nitrate-containing foods in the body. These are mainly plant foods, as nitrite is an intermediate product in the supply of nitrogen to the plant. Examples of nitrate-containing foods are salads and vegetables such as rocket, spinach, kohlrabi, beetroot and radish. Furthermore, nitrate converted into nitrite can react with amines, amides or amino acids (present for example in the gastrointestinal tract or in the production of meat products) to form nitrosamines. Many nitrosamines are potent genotoxic carcinogens in laboratory animals and it is assumed that many nitrosamines are also human carcinogens.",2019-11-14T00:00:00,2023-11-07T06:54:07,1.0,26.0,[316]

After being bitten by ticks, several patients suffered from fever and headaches – the typical symptoms of a TBE infection. And yet, no antibodies against the TBE virus or its genetic material could be detected in the affected individuals. Instead, the researchers found a previously unknown RNA virus, the Alongshan virus. The complete gene sequence of ALS viruses was found in numerous tick samples collected in several regions of Switzerland in 2021 and 2022. “Surprisingly, ALS viruses were detected in the tick samples far more frequently than TBE viruses,” says Cornel Fraefel, director of the Institute of Virology. Since the symptoms of an infection with ALS viruses are similar to those of an infection with TBE viruses, the Alongshan virus could already pose a public health concern in Switzerland, albeit hitherto unrecognized. At present a possible transmission also via milk, like TBE, is not known.",2022-12-13T07:50:37,2023-08-02T08:41:08,3.0,4.0,[208]
154,1,F-2021-302,Streptococcus suis - from pigs to humans,"The Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus suis is an emerging zoonotic agent that causes fatal infections such as septicaemia and meningitis in humans. In recent decades, the number of reported human cases of S. suis infection has increased rapidly, and three epidemics were recorded in China in 1998, 2005 and most recently in 2016. The recent increase in the global spread of virulent S. suis suggests its adaptive evolution in humans. However, this has remained largely elusive as no evidence of genetic adaptation to humans has been reported. The bacterium Streptococcus suis has long been known to cause swine disease. A genomic analysis has narrowed down where and when the deadly bacterium jumped from pigs to humans: in Europe in the 1960s or 1970s. To trace the evolution of S. suis, researchers from China analysed 1,634 S. suis genomes collected over 36 years from pigs and humans in 14 countries. The genomes fell into three distinct groups, one of which was found mainly in humans. This group included strains that caused severe diseases in zebrafish, which the authors used as a model for human diseases. Some of these strains had been collected from pigs that showed no signs of disease, suggesting that asymptomatic animals may have acted as vectors that transmitted the bacterium to humans. The researchers traced the origins of the human group to Europe during the 1960s and 1970s, when the continent was exporting pigs worldwide.",2021-07-12T00:00:00,2022-09-19T09:25:29,1.0,3.0,[925]

Platforms offer consumers the possibility of having their food delivered and ready-to-eat by the restaurant of their choice, whereby different people in the same household can have a wide variety of dishes delivered to their home at the same time (e.g., smood.ch). Another option is to go eat at someone's place who offers their services on an internet platform (e.g., de.eatwith.com); yet another option is to have someone cook for you at home (e.g., deinkoch.ch). There are numerous delivery platforms, such as: Uber Eats, Deliveroo, Blue Apron, Amazon restaurants, GrubHub, Eat street, just eat, etc. In contrast to already existing offers, 'ghost kitchens' are establishing themselves, which uniquely produce on an industrial scale for delivery services and deliver to customers. A dining room with guests is no longer needed. Production and delivery can be industrialised using robots and drones. Bank analysts assume that there is great growth potential.

Swiss legislation requires fish that is to be consumed raw must be subjected to a treatment that inactivates the larvae of Anisakis. However, the larvae, even when dead, pose an allergenic risk to some consumers. Allergic and anaphylactic symptoms have been observed with increasing frequency, even after eating well-cooked fish. There is now evidence that the digestion of material from dead parasites in food also poses a risk (J.
