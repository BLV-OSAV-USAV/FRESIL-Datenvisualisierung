They are also popular in food packaging because the substances are water and fat repellent. However, in animal studies, some of them have been shown to be liver-damaging, toxic to reproduction and probably carcinogenic. PFAS are of particular concern because, unlike other common contaminants that pass quickly through the human body, they can linger for years and thus accumulate cumulatively. This property has given them the name ""forever chemicals"". PFASs can also enter the food chain through environmental pollution, for example when plants are supplied with contaminated water or grown in contaminated soil, such as near factories or places where products containing PFASs have been used for firefighting.

93,10,F-2021-133,"Cannabinoids CBD,CBG,CBN,Δ-8 THC in foods","Foods containing extracts of hemp or cannabinoids (such as CBD) represent the current trend in Switzerland (FSVO, leaflet). The product range containing CBD includes various product categories, which are mainly sold on the internet. CBD, unlike THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), is not subject to the Federal Act on Narcotics (BetmG, SR 812.121) because it has no similar psychoactive effect. However, cannabinoids and hemp extracts are essentially novel foods, which is why they cannot be added to food as one pleases. In the USA, for a long time, the FDA had classified CBD as GRAS ('generally recognised as safe'), i.e. as a food additive, the substance was deemed to be harmless. However, this classification has now been revised and the FDA warns of possible side effects, such as liver damage, interactions with other drugs, fatigue, diarrhea and mood swings. Cannabigerol (CBG) is - similar to CBD - a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found in various cannabis species. It has a relaxing effect but does not cause drowsiness; instead, it has an energising effect. CBG is thought to have medicinal potential, for example as an anti-inflammatory or when treating pain and nausea. However, cannabinoid research has not progressed enough to support the definitive treatment potential of cannabinoids. The FOPH writes: ""Regarding the effects attributed to CBD, research is still in its infancy and it is quite impossible to confirm or deny its effects and its usefulness for clinical practice. In general, it remains to be said that its efficacy is claimed to be more promising than what has been proven, but CBD is likely to be effective for certain symptoms and disorders"".In its 2019 European Food Trends Report, the GDI states that the market for 'drinkables' and 'edibles' - foods and beverages containing cannabis - is booming. Other cannabinoids are entering the market, such as cannabigerol (CBG) . CBD is the hype of the decade - according to New Food 2020 - but with the market for cannabidiol oversaturated in the U.S., product companies will introduce other cannabinoids such as cannabinol (CBN) and cannabigerol (CBG), which are said to have functional benefits regarding sleep and appetite manipulation. According to Food News, the FDA is expected to voice its concerns about these 'cannabis-derived compounds'. However, it is still expected that they will be marketed. Inquiries about this have already reached the FSVO. Since CBD is currently becoming a trend product and is offered in various forms (as drops, as food ingredient, in cosmetics, etc.), it is quite possible that other cannabinoids such as CBG will also become popular in the future. In Ireland, poisoning in children has occured 1) after the consumption of sweets (Ir Med J Vol. 2021 Vol.114, No. 8 p446). It is also suspected that synthetic cannabinoids were used.

The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change.

180,4,F-2022-336,Nano coating of foods,"There is currently a lot of investment in research to develop new types of food packaging and a trend towards sustainable and also edible forms of packaging. Edible packaging is usually made of sustainable, biodegradable material. On the one hand, this includes packaging such as yoghurt pots that can be eaten, but also edible coatings that are placed around the food. In Switzerland, edible coatings of fruits and some vegetables are permitted, e.g. beeswax (E 901) as a coating for apples. Provided that the substances are approved as food additives for the respective food. What is new is that more and more packaging or coating agents are now being developed in nano form. Depending on the application, these are nanofibres, nanoparticles, nanoemulsions or even nanoencapsulations. A current example is the development of a nano-cellulose layer for fruits and vegetables, which is made from pomace (pressed out fruit and vegetable peels). The project is a collaboration between Lidl and researchers at EMPA. The reason for using nano-forms is manifold. Nano-form coatings allow thin edible layers on the food (about 5nm thickness). Coatings based on nanotechnology usually also allow better regulation of moisture in the food and better gas exchange for longer shelf life. In addition, nanocoatings can enable other functions such as the incorporation of so-called nanosensors in food, which indicate the spoilage of food (so-called ""smart packaging""). Various legal and health issues arise in the application. For example, in the case of the cellulose developed by EMPA, it is not clear whether the already approved coating agents (celluloses E 460-469) cover the newly developed cellulose or whether it would need a new approval. Secondly, there are questions about the toxicity of the nanoparticles through the consumption of the edible layers, which need to be carefully clarified before new nanoforms can be put on the market. A report by the RIVM in the Netherlands, for example, points out that specific risk assessments are needed for nanocellulose applications in the food sector, and that these might even have to be considered as novel foods. Retailers and Empa (Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology) are researching protective cellulose coating for fruit and vegetable products. The innovative coating is made from so-called pomace (press residue) and in the future, is to be used for retailers' products. The innovative project can reduce packaging and avoid food waste. No fresh vegetables are to be used for the novel protective coating, only organic residues. At Empa's Cellulose & Wood Materials lab, commissioned by a retailer, researchers developed a special protective cellulose layer that can be applied to fruit and vegetables within a year's time. The result: the coated fruits and vegetables stay significantly longer fresh. In tests, for example, the shelf life of bananas could be extended by more than a week.Other materials for alternative packaging and substitutes for plastics are being researched, including silk, for example.",True,2022-03-16T00:00:00,2023-10-05T06:54:59,1.5,23.0,"[147, 185, 209, 429]"

Several studies have investigated this hypothesis but have come to different conclusions. A connection between high nitrite intake from meat products and an increased cancer risk can neither be clearly proven nor disproven. Moreover, it is not only the consumption of a food that plays a role in the development of the disease, but the interaction between all lifestyle habits such as diet, exercise, alcohol and cigarette consumption, etc. Nitrite is not only absorbed through cured meat products, but is also formed as a degradation product of nitrate-containing foods in the body. These are mainly plant foods, as nitrite is an intermediate product in the supply of nitrogen to the plant. Examples of nitrate-containing foods are salads and vegetables such as rocket, spinach, kohlrabi, beetroot and radish. Furthermore, nitrate converted into nitrite can react with amines, amides or amino acids (present for example in the gastrointestinal tract or in the production of meat products) to form nitrosamines.

With this purpose, more effective antimicrobial compounds of natural origin such as bacteriocins, bacteriophages and essential oils have been preferred over synthetic ones and new encapsulation strategies such as emulsions, core-shell nanofibres, cyclodextrins and liposomes among others, have been applied in order to protect these antimicrobials from degradation or volatilization while trying to enable a more controlled release and sustained antimicrobial action. This trend brought new challenges regarding the incorporation of these new products into these novel packaging materials in terms of antimicrobial-packaging material compatibilities and, the most important one, the decreased stability of these natural-based compounds as they are more prone to suffer degradation by heat and light. Furthermore, there are other losses to be faced when incorporating some of these antimicrobials in packaging materials due to their inherent volatilization.",False,2023-01-30T07:13:34,2023-01-30T11:01:25,1.5,6.0,"[264, 147]"
150,2,F-2022-298,Artificial sweeteners influence microbiome,"New research shows that common artificial sweeteners can cause previously healthy gut bacteria to become sick and invade the gastrointestinal wall, potentially leading to serious health problems. The study by Shil and Chichger (2021) , published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, is the first to show the pathogenic effects of some of the most commonly used artificial sweeteners, saccharin, sucralose and aspartame, on two types of gut bacteria, E. coli (Escherichia coli) and E. faecalis (Enterococcus faecalis). Previous studies have shown that artificial sweeteners can change the number and type of bacteria in the gut, but this new molecular research, led by scientists at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), has shown that sweeteners can also make the bacteria pathogenic. It was found that these pathogenic bacteria can attach to, invade, and kill Caco-2 cells, the epithelial cells that line the gastrointestinal wall. It is known that bacteria such as E. faecalis that cross the intestinal wall can enter the bloodstream and accumulate in the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen, causing a range of infections including septicaemia. In this new study, it was found that at concentrations equivalent to two cans of diet soft drink, all three artificial sweeteners significantly increased the adhesion of E. coli and E. faecalis to intestinal Caco-2 cells and differentially increased the formation of biofilms (Eurek Alert).The substance D-allulose belongs to the group of simple sugars (monosaccharides).The specific risk of favouring human pathogenic bacteria in the human body by food ingredients is to be considered as a possible ""emerging risk"". Aspartame, an artificial sweetener, has been repeatedly criticised for not being safe. This thesis has been taken up in various studies and examined by means of meta-analyses. The authors Millstone and Dawson conclude that it is premature to call aspartame 'safe' because the studies conducted by the EFSA to assess aspartame are flawed.Concerns are also raised concerning the sweetener D-allulose. The sweetness of D-allulose corresponds to about 70% of the sweeteness of household sugar (sucrose), but leads to a significantly lower calorie intake, which is why the substance is advertised as a sugar substitute. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has yet to issue an opinion on the safety of D-allulose as a novel food. The BfR (German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment) reported that the use of D-allulose as a food ingredient could selectively promote the growth of bacteria of the Klebsiella genus, such as K. pneumoniae, in the human body. From a risk assessment perspective, the extent to which regular consumption of previously uncommon amounts of D-allulose as a novel food will undesirably influence the occurrence of Klebsiella spp. in the human gut microbiome remains to be scientifically determined.",True,2022-05-31T00:00:00,2023-10-17T07:41:23,1.0,23.0,"[69, 323]"

To test the hypothesis that soybean oil diets alter hypothalamic gene expression in relation to metabolic phenotype, the research group below performed RNA sequencing analysis with male mice that were fed isocaloric, high-fat diets based on conventional soybean oil (high in linoleic acid, LA), a genetically modified low-LA soybean oil (plenish) and coconut oil (high in saturated fat, without LA). Both soybean oil diets had similar but not identical effects on the hypothalamic transcriptome, while the coconut oil diet had a negligible effect compared to a low-fat control diet. Dysregulated genes were associated with inflammation, neuroendocrine, neurochemical and insulin signalling. Oxt was the only gene with metabolic, inflammatory, and neurological relevance that was upregulated by both soybean oil diets compared to both control diets. Oxytocin immunoreactivity in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus was reduced, while plasma oxytocin and hypothalamic Oxt were increased. These central and peripheral effects of the soybean oil diet correlated with glucose intolerance but not with body weight. In the coconut oil diet enriched with stigmasterol, a phytosterol derived from soybean oil, changes in hypothalamic Oxt and plasma oxytocin were not observed. The research team discovered about 100 other genes that are also affected by the soybean oil diet. They believe that this discovery could have implications not only for the energy metabolism, but also for important brain functions and diseases such as autism and Parkinson's disease. However, it has been indicated that there is no evidence that the oil causes these diseases. Furthermore, the team noted that the findings only applied to soybean oil - not to other soy products or other vegetable oils.",True,2021-01-05T00:00:00,2023-02-07T09:11:19,1.0,12.0,[759]
250,1,F-2023-033,Dimethylated Thioarsenates in rice,"Arsenic (As) occurrence in rice is a serious human health threat. Worldwide, regulations typically limit only carcinogenic inorganic As, but not possibly carcinogenic dimethylated oxyarsenate (DMA). However, there is emerging evidence that “DMA”, determined by routine acid-based extraction and analysis, hides a substantial share of dimethylated thioarsenates that have similar or higher cytotoxicities than arsenite. Risk assessments characterizing the in vivo toxicity of rice-derived dimethylated thioarsenates are urgently needed. In the meantime, either more sophisticated methods based on enzymatic extraction and separation of dimethylated oxy- and thioarsenates have to become mandatory or total As should be regulated.Since the publication of the 2009 EFSA opinion on arsenic in food new studies have become available on the toxic effects of organic arsenic. Furthermore it has become clear that dimethylmonothioarsenate (DMMTA) is formed from methyl arsenate due to the application of sulphate fertilisers, and that this substance could be more toxic than methylarsenate. It is therefore appropriate to update the hazard identification and characterisation of organic arsenic. On the basis of the available occurrence data for organic arsenic or literature information on organic arsenic in food, the exposure could be estimated in order to carry out an assessment for the risks for human health related to organic arsenic in food. In view of different properties of the methylated arsenic species, arsenobetaine, arsenolipids and arsenosugars, it is appropriate to assess the organic arsenic species in 2 separate opinions: an opinion on methylated arsenic species and an opinion on arsenobetaine, arsenolipids and the arsenosugars, which should also include any other possible organic arsenic species. After finalising the risk assessments on inorganic and organic arsenic, also the combined exposure to inorganic and organic arsenic should be assessed (source: Open EFSA (europa.eu))",False,2023-11-09T07:40:13,2023-11-10T08:14:13,1.0,6.0,[933]

Over 30 different species are responsible for this, but the species Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) is the most common. Azoles, mainly triazoles, are used to prevent or treat Aspergillus spp. infections in humans and plants. Resistance of Aspergillus usually results from long-term treatments with triazoles. However, A. fumigatus has been isolated from patients who have never been treated with such drugs. It is therefore suspected that resistant strains spread in the environment. These strains may have acquired their resistance through the use of triazole-based fungicides. Azole resistance is therefore described as an emerging problem. In Germany, an increased number of aspergilloses have been observed in the last 5 years. In agriculture, resistance to Aspergillus also seems to be increasing, probably due to changes in cultivation techniques (minimum tillage) which may promote contamination and the growth of Aspergillus. Another risk is the emergence of cross-resistance.
