22#10#20.05.2018 00:00:00# When there is an increase of detected anthraquinones in foods, this has risk management implications (a maximum treshold has to be determined). This also has implications on risk assessments (open questions on the significance of smoked, roasted products). The question is classified as relevant. It has to be stressed that anthraquinones can potentially occur during drying/smoking processes; which means that there is also the possibility of contamination in other similarly produced products (and therefore a chance that the maximum threshold is exceeded); the fact that the maximum threshold for tea is regulated does not necessarily mean that it does not pose a problem in similarly produced products. There are reliable indications that this issue is likely to occur in other foods as well.

28#10#12.07.2021 00:00:00#A first case of Streptococcus suis infection was reported in Switzerland in 2020. Olearo et al. (2020) report the first imported human case of Streptococcus suis infection in Switzerland, transmitted through the consumption of raw pork imported from a small local farm in Moldova. A 45-year-old woman bought and consumed the imported meat alone 24 h before her flight back to Geneva,. Three days after consumption, she was hospitalised with septic shock. Streptococcus suis was identified by sequencing 16 rDNA in blood cultures. Antibiotic disc diffusion tests based on EUCAST showed a multisensitive isolate, so that empirical treatment with ceftriaxone could be replaced by penicillin G for a total duration of 22 days until the patient was discharged. Serotyping of the S. suis strain identified a serotype 14, based on a high-resolution enamel assay. The genome sequence of the S. suis isolate GE-034 showed that it was only distantly related to strains isolated from pigs in Switzerland. The isolate belonged to sequence type ST1 (PubMLST id2250), which had not been reported previously for Swiss S. suis isolates.#154#2021-07-12T00:00:00#-100#2022-09-19T09:25:29#860#1#2021-07-12#2022-09-19

42#10#16.11.2021 00:00:00#Awareness of the importance of the microbiome for human health, but also for human health, animals and the environment, has grown in recent years. However, little is still known about the influence of additives, contaminants, or even food supplements on the microbiome. Due to the great variety of methods used in the studies, it is also difficult to assess the validity of the existing studies without specific knowledge. It is therefore proposed to formulate a research mandate and to invite tenders for a project. As a first step, a comprehensive literature review should be carried out to critically evaluate the existing studies on the influence of additives and other ingredients in food on the microbiome and to assess their validity with regard to the methods used. A possible contact point for project partners would be the NCCR Microbiome Consortium (nccr-microbiomes.ch). In view of the increased consumption of highly processed foods and the rise in metabolic disorders, as well as the role of the microbiome in the "One Health" context, such work would be valuable for an overall risk assessment of food.#140#2021-11-16T00:00:00#-100#2022-09-19T16:25:54#860#2#2021-11-16#2022-09-19

52#10#05.08.2019 00:00:00#"According to the investigations carried out by the FOPH in collaboration with the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO), the canton of Basel and customs, the probability of a scenario in which food contaminated with ruthenium-106 was imported into Switzerland from the vicinity of the point of release is extremely low. Furthermore, the potential health risk associated with such a scenario is also very low. It thus does not seem justified to carry out systematic controls on the radioactive contamination of foodstuffs imported into Switzerland from areas south of the Urals." Radiation protection and monitoring of radioactivity in Switzerland (2017). The fallout (which is relevant for food) was low in Switzerland and probably also in the EU. However, the article by Masson et al. (2019) contains only sparse information on this. Nevertheless, in parts of the EU they may have been as high as approx. 100 Bq/m2 , which is not completely negligible. (After Chernobyl, the fallout in Switzerland was about <3,000 to 45,000 Bq/m2 for Cs-137 and in the same order of magnitude or even twice as large for Ru-103. Ru-106 was also similar to Cs-137 in some cases, but probably lower overall. Ru-106 is comparatively poorly documented after Chernobyl). Sv/Bq is somewhat lower for Ru-106 than for Cs-137 when ingested by adults (although it is just the opposite for inhalation). Since the half-life (approx. 370 days) is considerably shorter than for Cs-137, the potential problem will soon be reduced even further (at present already approx. 4 x smaller). Ru (106 and 103) are mainly relevant in the case of direct deposition, i.e. when the fallout settles directly on plant parts. This is only relevant a short time after the fallout and mainly affects aromatic herbs and tea herbs and at most leafy vegetables. It is fairly certain that Ru and its derived products are hardly taken up by plants, and absorption in humans and animals is also much lower than with Cs, for example. Ru-103 has a half-life of about 40 days and therefore does not play a major role relatively soon. Ru (103 and 106) is flushed or transported from the uppermost soil layers to deeper layers more quickly than Cs.#61#2019-08-05T00:00:00#-100#2022-09-15T15:15:00#860#1#2019-08-05#2022-09-15

In a study published in 2009 (Toxoplasma gondii: Infektionsquellen und -risiken in der Schweiz (admin.ch), meat samples from cattle, sheep and pigs from Switzerland were examined both serologically and by PCR for the presence of Toxoplasma infection. The results showed that the risk of infection to humans comes from both meat and cats, and that the risk of exposure has increased rather than decreased. #157#2021-08-10T00:00:00#-100#2022-09-19T10:18:37#860#1#2021-08-10#2022-09-19

The blockchain's potential in the food safety industry has to be explored before any measures can be defined. In Switzerland, there are already companies who are working in the blockchain field regarding the food industry. The following questions arise: What is the blockchain all about? What is its potential regarding food safety/fraud and traceability? What implications does this have on the food industry and supervisory bodies? For now, this piece of information is deemed generally important; there is no need for action by the FSVO concluded. The development of blockchain with regard to the food industry will be observed passively. Blockchain technology is being employed selectively until now. Cases of individual purposes in the food industry are published. Like in other similar applications, technology is only as performant as the data fed into the system.

61#10#20.05.2018 00:00:00# It can be assumed that foxes can cross the border between France and Switzerland and that, as a consequence, there could be an increase in cases in Switzerland as well (or have the Swiss foxes reached France?). As early as 2007, it was found that human alveolar echinococcosis was also increasing following an increase in the fox population. In the times before 2000, Switzerland recorded about 8-12 new cases of alveolar echinococcosis (AE) per year. Over the last 10-20 years, there has been a massive increase, both geographically and numerically. Today, the number of alveolar echinococcoses is 24-30 cases per year. It is therefore significantly higher than the number of cases in France. In 2017, the Cantonal Laboratory of Basel-Stadt examined fifty food samples (products close to the ground) for echinococcus eggs from Switzerland and abroad. No fox tapeworm eggs were detected in any of the samples examined. Further examinations were carried out in 2018. No eggs were detected in this series of examinations either (KLBS report 2018). The topic is deemed relevant and is to be monitored further. The situation in Switzerland shows the relevance of the topic. Investigations have been carried out at the food level and further research has been initiated.

95#10#09.04.2018 00:00:00# Azole resistance in Aspergillus spp. must be considered on three levels: Agricultural practice: Does the increased use of triazoles in agriculture lead to higher resistance? Are alternative products then increasingly used? Human aspergillosis Increase of mycotoxin contamination due to triazole resistance in Aspergillus spp. Aspergilli have never been observed in the grain monitoring carried out so far. However, it could be that with potentially increasing triazole applications (which are carried out against Fusarium, among other things), a corresponding selection of sporadically occurring Aspergillus species could take place. The effects on Switzerland are thus questionable; however, there is no systematically collected data on human aspergilloses in Switzerland. The issue is deemed relevant in the EU. For this reason, the issue will continue to be monitored. The assessment suggests that the problem is viewed in a more differentiated way in Switzerland. A need for action is not perceived at present. The relevance for Switzerland is rated as quite low. Assessment of the EREN expert network: EFSA summarised that there is a possibility of clinical as well as agricultural factors contributing to azole-resistance. Changing agricultural practices may promote azole-resistance. Treatment failure of fungicide in primary production may be a contributing factor. It would be helpful to explore the possibility of both environmental and agricultural factors that contribute to resistance. The relationship between consumption of drugs and the rate of resistance should be explored as well. EREN considered this issue as an emerging issue. #12#2018-04-13T00:00:00#-100#2023-02-14T08:13:36#932#5#2018-04-13#2023-02-14

105#10#11.12.2018 00:00:00# NENT results show stable isolation numbers. NENT analysed 95 shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC) human isolates from Switzerland from 2010 to 2014; results: the five most common serogroups were O157, O145, O26, O103, and O146. Of the 95 strains, 35 (36.8%) carried stx1 genes only, 43 strains (45.2%) carried stx2, and 17 (17.9%) harbored combinations of stx1 and stx2 genes. The detection of O80: [H2]-ST301 harboring stx2d, eae-ξ, hly, iha, and pS88-related genes suggests an ongoing emergence in Switzerland of an unusual, highly pathogenic STEC serotype (Fierz et al. 2017). The issue is deemed significant. The surge, relating to what has been analyised, cannot simply be explained by changes in the diagnostics of EHEC. A risk evaluation has been prepared and is filed in the documents section. As of August 2021, all EHEC-positive samples must be forwarded to the NENT. In the future, however, this should be done using an accurate form indicating the patient's hospitalisation status.

120#10#10.04.2018 00:00:00# It is suspected that more algal blooms are observed due to climate change, which may result in increased toxins in water bodies. Cyanobacteria grow mainly in freshwater, whereas dinoflagllates and Diatoma grow in seawater. For this reason, exposure to BMAA caused by cyanobacteria is possible. However, an intake of BMAA is also to be expected through the import of seafood and fish. Exposure of the Swiss population to BMAA is also conceivable in Switzerland. The problem (marine toxins in general) manifests itself mainly in countries with a connection to the sea. As a landlocked country, Switzerland is affected via food. A prioritisation of this issue is seen in countries with a marine connection. This has already been initiated in the case of Ciguatera toxin, for example. A European project is underway under the leadership of Spain. The consumption of seafood / fish in Switzerland is rather low compared to other European countries. However, should cases occur, the facts would have to be reassessed.

The number of reported cases has been increasing continuously since the last few years (2011: 17 cases; 2019: 40 cases). The hospitalisation rate is around 40%, mortality 0%. In comparison to the EU, the incidence of S. Napoli in Switzerland appears to be of about the same order of magnitude as in the EU. Outbreaks are rather rare and it is likely to be a diffusely occurring pathogen in space and time, which, however, seems to show a pronounced seasonality (May to October). Further evaluations are indicated. In 2021, analyses within the cantons will be conducted. In the 2021 season, Serovar Napoli is to be analysed in more depth and possible sources for preventive measures are to be identified. #115#2021-05-18T00:00:00#-100#2023-10-30T13:05:42#84#14#2021-05-18#2023-10-30

The pharmaceuticals enter rivers and streams via sewers and sewage treatment plants, and from there they enter the groundwater with the river water. The main substances detected in groundwater are pharmaceuticals and X-ray contrast media used in human medicine. However, the concentrations are generally low and are usually less than 0.1 micrograms per litre (μg/l). (FOEN). Investigations conducted as part of the FOEN's NAQUA programme show that the four most frequently detected active substances include the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole, the antiepileptic carbamazepine and the X-ray contrast media amidotrizoic acid and iopamidol. Pharmaceuticals are detected primarily at monitoring sites in whose catchment area wastewater-polluted watercourses infiltrate into the groundwater.

219#10#18.05.2018 00:00:00# First, it is unclear whether Crohn's disease is caused by MAP at all. (This is extremely controversial). Secondly, it is unclear whether the pathogens can be found in milk. Extensive investigations (with PCR) in CH have not produced any evidence of MAP in milk. For this reason, the priority is classified as subordinate. 'It is unclear whether there is causal evidence between MAP ingestion and the occurrence of MC. Although a causal involvement of MAP in the development of MC has not been proven with certainty, it is often recommended for reasons of precautionary consumer health protection to minimise the exposure of consumers to MAP in food as far as possible. This means to reduce or prevent the entry into the food chain and into ready-to-eat food as far as possible. In the dairy chain, different process technologies for germ reduction (e.g. heating) should be used. The consumption of raw milk should be avoided'. (BfR 4th meeting of the Commission for Biological Hazards and Hygiene, Dec. 2020) The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) and the Max Rubner Institute (MRI) conducted an extensive literature review and come to the conclusion (July 2021) that there are still no valid scientific results that prove such a connection (Joint report no. 022/2021 by BfR and MRI on 15th Juli 2021). The FSVO analysed (2012) 896 tank milk samples for MAP. Using various methods, no MAP could be detected. #2#2018-05-23T00:00:00#-100#2023-02-13T16:07:58#932#6#2018-05-23#2023-02-13

For this reason, and because OSS were considered to be of little relevance in the preliminary study, they will not be integrated into the continuing project. #9#2018-12-19T00:00:00#-100#2023-01-24T10:38:23#932#2#2018-12-19#2023-01-24

A prerequisite for the regulation of nano- and microplastics is the availability of reliable detection methods in food. At present, neither of these prerequisites seems to be fulfilled. Therefore, we do not see any need from a management point of view".

272#10#19.12.2018 00:00:00# OSS are authorised in Switzerland, so the same conclusions can be drawn. 1 - In a first step, a preliminary study was carried out to identify the most important co-formulants in terms of quantity that are applied to agricultural crops and that can potentially lead to residues in food due to their application method and substance properties (e.g. persistence). This preliminary study enables follow-up studies in which residues of the identified co-formulants can be measured and their risk assessed. The report can be found on the website of the FSVO or in English on the EFSA Knowledge Junction. 2 - As part of the Action Plan for Risk Reduction and Sustainable Use of Plant Protection Products, consumer risks from formulation co-formulants of plant protection products in food are to be identified and, if necessary, new measures defined. To this end, the FSVO, together with Agroscope-Wädenswil, has carried out various studies which have culminated in field trials in which the residues of various formulants on various crops were characterised.

358#30#02.09.2019 00:00:00#Discussion: It has to be distinguished between products acquired on the internet (from abroad) for personal use (case 1), acquired on the internet on platforms based in Switzerland (case 2), acquired in shops (from the shelves) in Switzerland (case 3). The existing food law does not cover products acquired abroad for personal use (case 1). Therefore no actions are required. For products acquired from platforms based in Switzerland (case 2), similar problems occur as discussed under 3.5. Consumers expect these products as being safe. In general, enforcement authorities underline that products in Switzerland (case 3) are safe, but labelling seems indeed a problem. More problematic are products, which are illegally sold “under the counter”. This topic has, however, to be addressed in the context of fraud. Recommendations Focus on case 2 and 3 only; Treat case 2 as discussed in chapter 3.5. Case 3: To be discussed within the Commission “Produktekontrolle” what strategy seems best: to control within Switzerland or at the border. #27#2023-01-20T08:39:57#932#2023-02-13T14:49:49#932#2#2023-01-20#2023-02-13

Question of fraud; to be discussed in the Product Control Commission regarding further action. Topic is classified as relevant (to be kept in mind); synergies with other authorities and organisations appear to make sense. Feedback from GEFA: Risk communication would make sense: This should be done primarily in combination with campaigns that have been carried out; the existing campaigns on NEM that have been/are being carried out in the cantons should be compiled. The results of the cantons' regional campaign 2019 should be awaited and then the further procedure discussed. Risk management: Inclusion in the 2020 priority programme for controls at the border. The difficulty, however, lies in being able to collect the "right" products in the first place. If necessary, it would make more sense to survey the products on the internal market. The topic will be brought to the Product Control Commission by LME (Bem). Decision GEFA Internal meeting 21.10.2019 if necessary then to be discussed in the Product Control Commission regarding further procedure. The topic should be brought to the next meeting of the Product Control Committee (Bem). Discussion of the "best" approach with the COM.

Carry out literature research on MAP in past. milk then and carry out a reassessment if necessary. Meeting of the BfR Commission on Biological Hazards and Hygiene: Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease. Protokoll vom 7.12.2020 : In summary, it is stated that the greatest uncertainties in risk assessment lie in the area of exposure estimation. It is unclear whether there is causal evidence between MAP intake and the occurrence of MC. Although a causal involvement of MAP in the development of MC has not been proven with certainty, it is often recommended for reasons of precautionary consumer health protection to minimise consumer exposure to MAP in food as far as possible. This means to reduce or prevent the entry into the food chain and into ready-to-eat food as far as possible. In the dairy chain, different process technologies for germ reduction (e.g. heating) should be used. Consumption of raw milk should be avoided. #2#2023-01-23T16:09:50#932#2023-02-13T16:07:58#932#3#2023-01-23#2023-02-13

386#40#20.05.2018 00:00:00# Introduce the topic to the OneHealth working group of the FSVO in order to address the following questions: Contact the FOPH and clarify how many cases there actually are in Switzerland. What is the basis for the estimate of 10-20 cases per year (this would be massively more than in FR, for example). Contact KLBS regarding the echinococcosis project: ask for project plan and subsequent project report. Clarify in OneHealth: How is the screening of Swiss foxes compared to French/German foxes? Does this give any indication of the possible prevalence of human cases in Switzerland? Wait for findings from DE and FR and adapt them to CH if necessary. Ensure coordination between FOKO and WG OneHealth. Wait for the results of the research work within the framework of FOKO and bring them into the OneHealth WG; also the request from the IPZ (if they submit a project). Hold off on asking B.

388#30#28.03.2019 00:00:00# The topic should be focused on Vibrio spp. mainly. A value for Vibrio spp. in the hygiene regulation (HyV, OHyg) should be discussed in more depth. All other hazards seem to be well known and under control. Hazards should be distinguished between aquaculture and the wild. Hazards from the wild are of higher priority than the ones from aquaculture. Additionally, seafood should be addressed in risk communication. #11#2023-01-24T09:24:31#932#2023-01-24T09:24:31#932#0#2023-01-24#2023-01-24
389#40#13.05.2018 00:00:00# The topic should be broader as various food safety aspects (bacteria, viruses, heavy metals, organic compounds, etc.) are associated with it. It is suggested to address a topic on "seafood hygiene". Broaden topic : Working title "Hygiene of seafood". Topic to be presented to the advisory board and discussed there: Goal: Involve and collect recommendations: How do the business partners, the universities, the NENT see it? Clarify with laboratory (Richard Felleisen) whether a prevalence study of shrimps with Vibrio spp. could be carried out (commission tlu with fer to clarify this); Collate information on seafood and studies (viruses, bacteria, Cd... etc.) in advance of the Advisory Board meeting. Clarify with Kristine Hotz whether a customs campaign would be possible (how is the shrimp imported: by land or air?). Develop activities in the relevant bodies and actively ask who is doing what with Vibrio. I.e. what is going on in the EU, who is doing what in the EU, what is known in the relevant networks. Bring into EFSA in MRA; bring into EREN. Address the other problem areas in this context (antibiotic residues in shrimp, antibiotic resistance in Vibrio) in the One Health working group of the FSVO. Feedback GEFA: The topic of seafood will be investigated by the FSVO laboratory with a short prevalence study on Vibrio spp. in shrimps as planned this autumn; a decision will then be taken on the further procedure. #11#2023-01-24T09:24:31#932#2023-03-10T08:46:04#84#9#2023-01-24#2023-03-10

Methodology for detection exists at the FSVO (but is not in the accredited area); Importers of fleur de sel could be made aware of self-regulation (via the salt shelf). In Switzerland, the issue is likely to be in connection with water (drinking water from conditions, from pipes) in the foreground (and less seafood). #8#2023-01-24T09:33:50#932#2023-11-21T08:30:24#932#4#2023-01-24#2023-11-21

393#20#12.05.2018 00:00:00# Little relevance. Relevance does not appear to be given, as corresponding maximum values exist for tea, for example. "In the Bio ERFA group it was stated that due to the legal requirements of the LGV, good practice should be adhered to: Anthraquinone residues due to drying processes are technically avoidable in our opinion. Therefore, the intervention value of 0.01 mg/kg applies in the organic sector and the maximum residue level for tea 0.02 mg/kg from conventional production according to VPRH Annex 2. Producers are instructed to avoid residues during drying by taking appropriate measures such as filters, etc. The ball is in the tea sector's court. The ball is in the tea industry's court; there is no need for action through research. We adopt and follow EU law (incl. its risk assessment)". It remains to be noted that anthraquinones can potentially occur in drying processes / smoking processes; this means that there is also a possibility of contamination in other, similarly produced products (and thus an exceeding of a maximum value); the fact that these are regulated with regard to maximum value in tea does not necessarily mean that they do not pose a problem in similarly produced products. #4#2023-01-24T10:20:48#932#2023-02-14T07:59:29#932#2#2023-01-24#2023-02-14

395#40#22.05.2018 00:00:00# PAFF has discussed the issue: The EU COM is of the opinion that anthraquinone should be regulated in the phytosanitary legislation. The fact is that a few years ago it was decided not to regulate PAHs for tea. She suggests to check the facts and then decide again. A general regulation on PAHs could also indirectly solve the problem with anthraquinone, as there are indications that the formation of the substances is linked. Information should be sent to the Advisory Council and the topic and assessment briefly presented there. At the moment, the topic is considered to be of little relevance, as the responsibility lies with the manufacturers. In terms of risk management, information on the topic via the FSVO newsletter (recommendation to the sector) should be examined. Feedback from GEFA: Anthraquinone: It is proposed to prepare a small assessment contribution. ( B.

401#40#10.04.2018 00:00:00# The problem (marine toxins in general) manifests itself mainly in countries connected to the sea. As a landlocked country, CH is affected via food. Prioritisation of this issue is seen in countries with a marine connection. This has already been initiated in the case of Ciguatera toxin, for example. A European project is underway under the leadership of ESP. The consumption of seafood / fish in Switzerland is rather low compared to other European countries. However, should cases occur, the facts would have to be reassessed.

Nestlé uses a similar approach for food fraud, but not for food safety. In future artificial intelligence may help to address such an approach, by using existing databases and algorithms that may identify “new” issues. Conclusion: ACE takes note from this approach and is looking forward to discuss any drivers in future, which have been identified by FSVO. #44#2023-01-25T14:51:51#932#2023-02-13T14:33:43#932#2#2023-01-25#2023-02-13

It is suggested to add Cl. difficile to the list of the ESKAPE[1]-Group, which were already discussed in ACE (see minutes of 7th meeting referring to Acinetobacter spp.). During routine exchange between FOPH and FSVO, the topic should be addressed to get more in-depth information from public health of this topic. Observing the literature of the role of Cl. difficile might be useful to be able to advise vulnerable people what food might have to be avoided. Only after any discussions within OneHealth, further steps should be undertaken to develop e.g. analytical methods to be used in food microbiology and to perform any studies to identify prevalence of possible high risk products. [1] ESKAPE is the acronym for a group of bacteria consisting of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter species. These bacteria are often the cause of life-threatening nosocomial infections, especially in seriously ill and immunocompromised persons. ESKAPE pathogens often develop antibiotic resistance and thus represent a major challenge in everyday clinical practice. #110#2023-01-25T15:48:57#932#2023-01-25T15:48:57#932#0#2023-01-25#2023-01-25

The following activities were proposed: In-depth research to clarify the following: a. What is known about "Tara protein flour" (focus on food safety)? b. Does it already have risk assessments? c. Clarify the legal situation in Switzerland ((Traditional) Novel Food?). Does it have information in the cantons on the products that are marketed in the canton?

411#30#15.12.2022 00:00:00# It is not a 100% sure that tara [protein] flour was the culprit of this outbreak in the US. Nevertheless, due to its high protein content (and therefore potential use in vegan, vegetarian products) further research seems useful. It might be possible, that in this particular outbreak, a failure in producing tara[protein]flour may have occurred. A follow-up of the case should be done by contacting appropriate organizations (FDA, WHO via Infosan). The toxicology of tara protein (not E 417) seems not clear (ask B: Engeli) and it might have a status as novel. A verification of the product(s) already advertised and used on the Swiss market seems useful. CS is asked to provide further information, especially referring on specification, where the product is used, and what a safe use of tara[protein]flour includes. #212#2023-01-25T15:54:57#932#2023-01-25T15:54:57#932#0#2023-01-25#2023-01-25

431#30#29.06.2023 00:00:00#ACE takes notice of this signal. It was concluded, that the signal is of a certain importance with a lower urgency however. For further evaluations, it was proposed to: To undertake a literature review and to identify any significant difference of S. aureus and S. argenteus for a routine analysis especially. To undertake an explorative study to investigate the occurrence of this germ in food. #179#2023-08-11T15:00:06#932#2023-11-22T14:25:23#932#1#2023-08-11#2023-11-22
432#30#28.06.2023 00:00:00#ACE takes notice of this signal. It was concluded, that the signal is of a certain importance, however with a lower urgency. The topic should be addressed as the human microbiome might be disturbed, more fermented products come onto the market and antimicrobial resistances are still a challenge. For further evaluations, it was proposed to: Investigate what are the intentionally added starter cultures in fermented and non-fermented foods. Check with suppliers of starter cultures to find out whether and how they test for antimicrobial resistance. #236#2023-08-11T15:02:12#932#2023-11-22T14:26:32#932#2#2023-08-11#2023-11-22

434#40#16.08.2023 00:00:00# The information on the website on Vibrio spp. should be revised and the aspects included in the next adaptation. The topic is being discussed and worked on internationally (e.g. BfR). The corresponding findings should be followed up. No further activities are planned, as the FSVO's priority is primarily Listeria spp. and Campylobacter spp. #11#2023-09-08T14:54:56#932#2023-09-08T14:54:56#932#0#2023-09-08#2023-09-08
435#20#23.08.2023 00:00:00# A certain relevance is given. Data on Yersinia spp. in human cases and in foodstuffs should be determined for Switzerland in order to be able to assess the issue at all. Contact with the NENT (via ACE) would appear to be expedient. Methods for the detection of Yersinia spp. are available, but minor laboratory-specific adaptations would be required. #16#2023-09-08T14:59:57#932#2023-11-22T14:29:03#932#1#2023-09-08#2023-11-22

438#30#02.09.2023 00:00:00# The topic is of interest and should clearly be followed up closely. The proposed activities make sense and should be initiated : · Literature review: Importance of Helicobacter spp. as a "foodborne pathogen" and detection of the pathogen in food and water, including its antibiotic resistance in Switzerland. · A small prevalence study of H. pylori in food would be supportive including also analysis of antimicrobial resistance of isolates identified in food, which should then also be compared with medical isolates. #239#2023-09-27T09:53:46#932#2023-11-22T14:27:43#932#1#2023-09-27#2023-11-22
