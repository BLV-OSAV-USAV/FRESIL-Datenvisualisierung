11,2,F-2018-027,Vibrio spp. in seafood,"V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus are marine bacterial microorganisms that can occur in seawater, especially at warmer temperatures. They are the main cause of bacterial diseases caused by seafood. These pathogens are regularly detected in the USA and Asia. In Europe, the pathogen is hardly ever found. There are fears that these pathogens will become increasingly important as the oceans warm up. The severity of the diseases caused by V. vulnificus can be described as very severe. According to literature, the lethality rate is over 50% after infection. This makes it one of the most serious pathogens in terms of lethality in the area of food-borne diseases. The FDA regulation expresses this with a zero tolerance. In the EU and Switzerland, there is no regulation of this pathogen. In addition, various publications report the multiple development of antibiotic resistance in these pathogens, caused by the use of antibiotics in aquacultures. Environmental and patient isolates show similar resistance profiles. These included resistance to ampicillin, penicillin and tetracycline. HorizonScan: Since 1999, 250 reports of Vibrio spp. in shrimp have been recorded.",2018-12-20T00:00:00,2023-09-11T08:25:35,1.0,26.0,"[940, 903]"
181,2,F-2022-337,Safety of probiotics,"The microbiome affects the initiation and progression of cancerous tumours through direct effects on tumour cells, and indirectly through manipulation of the immune system. It can also determine the response to cancer therapies and predict disease progression and survival (Jain et al., 2021). There is vast literature on the beneficial effects of probiotics for the prevention and treatment of cancer. A review of the available literature on the subject was published in 2022. The authors conclude that probiotics have been shown to be effective against various types of cancer, but also that there is a need to evaluate the adverse effects of probiotics (gastrointestinal side effects, skin reactions, access to antibiotic resistance genes, harmful effects of metabolites, abnormal stimulation of the immune system) (Sankarapandian et al., 2022). Cancer patients have compromised immunity due to primary disease, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The effects of probiotics in this population may differ from those in healthy individuals and raise several critical issues (Lu et al., 2021). A new publication states that Lactobacillus can alter the function of immune cells (macrophages) in the pancreatic tumour environment and stimulate cancer growth (Hezaveh et al., 2022). The mechanism involves the metabolisation of dietary tryptophan by bacteria in the gut, which leads to an inactivation of immune cells involved in tumour control. This is not the only indication of potentially harmful effects of probiotic microorganisms, even independently of the presence of cancer. Among others:

Although probiotic bacteria are generally recognised as safe (GRAS status), there are several reports of side effects triggered by the presence of these organisms: systemic infections, impact on the immune system, disruption of metabolism and horizontal gene transfer (Zawistowska-Rojek and Tyski, 2018).
Brain fog syndrome has been reported to be related to probiotic use, with symptoms improving with antibiotics and probiotic discontinuation (Rao et al., 2018).
Fungemia and other fungal infections have been associated with the use of probiotic supplements based on Saccharomyces boulardii (Rannikko et al., 2021).

149,2,F-2021-297,ESKAPE pathogens transmission via food,"ESKAPE is an acronym that encompasses the scientific names of six highly virulent and antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens, including: Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp. This group of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria can evade or 'escape' common antibiotics due to their increasing multi-drug resistance (MDR). As a result, they are the leading cause of life-threatening nosocomial or hospital-acquired infections in immunocompromised and critically ill patients worldwide, who are most at risk. The food chain is one of the main drivers of MDR transmission, as food is not sterile and can usually have microbiological contamination or become contaminated at certain stages of the food chain (i.e. cross-contamination, recontamination). Indeed, the food chain can act as a driver for MDR spread, enabling the survival or even multiplication of MDR pathogens. MDR transmission is not exclusive to foods of animal origin or fish; plant foods can also harbour MDR microorganisms, as vegetables can be contaminated during primary production by water contaminated with faecal material from wastewater from surrounding farms. In general, pathogens are not common in food and the main risk arises from the high prevalence of non-pathogenic microorganisms that can transfer AMR genes to other microbial species, including foodborne pathogens. It is well documented that genes encoding resistance are transferable between different bacteria in farm animals and also from them to bacteria in food and humans by horizontal gene transfer (i.e. transformation, conjugation and transduction).",2021-09-21T00:00:00,2023-09-18T07:41:56,2.0,9.0,"[923, 922]"
42,2,F-2019-062,Bacillus cereus sensu lato - Bacillus thuringiensis,"In agriculture, bacteria of the genus Bacillus are increasingly used as biocides or plant protection products respectively. B. thuringiensis in particular is used as an insecticide as these bacteria produce Bt toxins. The Bacillus cereus group (Bacillus cereus sensu lato) consists of the B. cereus sensu stricto, B. anthracis, B. thuringiensis, B. weihenstephanensis, B. mycoides, B. pseudomycoides, B. cytotoxicus, and B. toyonensis species. B. cereus and B. thuringiensis genotypically hardly differ. Furthermore, in clinical diagnostics, these species are not differentiated; therefore, it is unclear to what extent B. thuringiensis could have an impact on food-associated intoxications. The greatest difference between the two species is limited to the presence or absence of plasmids. Plasmids often code exotoxins. The mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer would enable a plasmid exchange in the Bacillus cereus sensu lato group. Whether and how this happens has not been closely investigated yet. Thus, whether B. thuringiensis can be detected in food samples has also not been investigated in greater detail. Recently, certain strain of B. thuringiensis was described as being able to produce large amounts of sphingomyelinase; several other strains of B. thuringiensis demonstrated cytotoxicity in vero cell assays. Therefore, these strains have to be potentially considered virulent. The investigated strains were all isolated from biocides. The safety of strains (QPS or GRAS) employed in agriculture is not explicitly demonstrated. In general, precise identification and characterisation of the strains used, in particular of B. thuringiensis and of possible virulence factors, are not available.",2019-07-11T00:00:00,2023-10-23T10:37:45,1.0,28.0,"[912, 918]"

7,1,F-2018-023,Microbiological safety: convenience products (produce),"Convenience (ready-to-eat) products are very popular. These products include vegetables and fruits that are ready to eat or can be prepared with minimal effort (e.g. heating). Such products also find their way into smoothies, where a variety of different fruits and vegetables are processed. Numerous outbreaks involving such products have been reported internationally. The range of possible pathogens includes:

Viral pathogens: NoV on raspberries, cherry tomatoes; HAV on dates, frozen pomegranate seeds.
Bacterial pathogens: salmonella on melons, basil, coconuts; STEC on lettuce; listeria on pre-cut vegetables
Parasitic pathogens: cyclospora on pre-cut vegetables; crypotosporidia in smoothies.

For example, from 2015 to 2018, an outbreak related to frozen ready-to-eat vegetables was ongoing. The source of this outbreak could be identified. In addition to frozen maize, other frozen vegetables have also been affected. 47 cases and 9 deaths have been linked to the outbreak. As a result, there have been global recalls of frozen vegetables, with thousands of tonnes destroyed. In the UK alone, more than 50 products were affected. Recalls were also issued in Switzerland. It was striking that listeriosis was caused in frozen products that were not ready for consumption. The question arises as to what the reasons for the listerioses were. The question arises: how can listerioses develop from frozen products that are not ready to eat? Is this a question of inadequate heating instructions (e.g. microwave: too few watts, too short thermal exposure, no homogeneous heating) or a question of production? Is it a question of cross-contamination in production, in households?",2018-09-25T00:00:00,2023-11-21T13:03:00,1.0,15.0,[927]
152,1,F-2021-300,Food waste: recycling leftovers,"Various initiatives have been launched to reduce food waste. One of them is 'too good to go'. Too good to go, for example, is a movement against food waste and the app of the same name is the world's largest business-to-consumer marketplace for leftover food. In Switzerland, more and more unsold food is sold this way. The idea of using technology to connect people in the fight against food waste was developed in Denmark in 2016 and quickly implemented across Europe. The Too Good To Go app connects people at the right time and place to reduce food waste. Currently, 'to good to go' is active in 14 European countries, and has also been present in Switzerland since summer 2018. The Too Good To Go app aims to create a win-win-win situation: Users receive food that has expired or is close to its expiry date at a reduced price. In addition, there are campaigns that supplement the best-before date (BBD) with the phrase 'often good for longer'. Numerous manufacturers in Switzerland have already added this supplement to the best-before date on their products (Press room, to good to go).Food waste is an economic problem, but also a moral one. But what about food safety? In recent times, food is being used beyond its expiry date, but how safe is it? Since November 2019, a retail chain in Switzerland has also been offering 'wonder bags' to counteract food waste. Bags filled with surplus products that can no longer be sold can be ordered and collected. The products cannot be selected by the buyer.

60,1,F-2019-099,"Pet food (Salmonella, Listeria)","Pet food, just like food for humans, can be contaminated by microbiological or chemical contaminants. This danger is exacerbated by the new food trend 'Barf' or 'Biologically Apporopriate Raw Food'. Barfing' involves feeding raw meat, offal, bones and ingredients such as fruit and vegetables. These are supposed to be good for the animal, but can be particularly contaminated with bacteria. Not only is there a risk of the animal becoming ill, but also the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. On the one hand, pet owners come into contact with the multi-resistant bacteria when preparing the food. On the other hand, pets have close contact with humans, which increases the risk of transmission from animal to human. Pet food for dogs has led to several outbreaks in humans. In the USA, for example, around 93 people in 27 states fell ill with various (multidrug-resistant) Salmonella serotypes in 2019 (4,[5],12:i:-, Infantis, Newport and London). Dried pig ears could be identified as the cause. Petfood recalls due to contamination with Salmonella are also taking place in Europe (RASFF notification).",2019-08-05T00:00:00,2022-09-16T11:14:10,1.0,3.0,[942]
154,1,F-2021-302,Streptococcus suis - from pigs to humans,"The Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus suis is an emerging zoonotic agent that causes fatal infections such as septicaemia and meningitis in humans. In recent decades, the number of reported human cases of S. suis infection has increased rapidly, and three epidemics were recorded in China in 1998, 2005 and most recently in 2016. The recent increase in the global spread of virulent S. suis suggests its adaptive evolution in humans. However, this has remained largely elusive as no evidence of genetic adaptation to humans has been reported. The bacterium Streptococcus suis has long been known to cause swine disease. A genomic analysis has narrowed down where and when the deadly bacterium jumped from pigs to humans: in Europe in the 1960s or 1970s. To trace the evolution of S. suis, researchers from China analysed 1,634 S. suis genomes collected over 36 years from pigs and humans in 14 countries. The genomes fell into three distinct groups, one of which was found mainly in humans. This group included strains that caused severe diseases in zebrafish, which the authors used as a model for human diseases. Some of these strains had been collected from pigs that showed no signs of disease, suggesting that asymptomatic animals may have acted as vectors that transmitted the bacterium to humans. The researchers traced the origins of the human group to Europe during the 1960s and 1970s, when the continent was exporting pigs worldwide.",2021-07-12T00:00:00,2022-09-19T09:25:29,1.0,3.0,[925]
